"Suboxone to Subetex Pros v Cons.. I was forced to the generics its been over a year and since I needed a PA we worked it out. Currently with insurance i pay $10 for the script. Figured the name brand would be $25 like all other non generics are, nope $400+.  So its a no brainer. 

So doc offered subutex. I really do not like the pill form. Feel like it takes forever to dissolve. Have things gotten better?",1,1,0,0,0,0
This is probably a silly question. Do I need to carry my subs in the prescription bottle when I leave the house ? The script is obviously mine but say I get pulled over and for some reason a dickhead cop searches me(completely hypothetical because I‚Äôm a total square) I don‚Äôt want him to take them. The bottle is just taking up so much room in my purse and it‚Äôs hard to close which means people I work with can sometimes see it if I don‚Äôt bury it. So‚Ä¶ moral of the long pointless story. Can I put them in a makeup bag and leave my bottle at home ? Really hoping at least one person is up can I can ditch the bottle tonight. ü•¥üôÉ,1,0,0,0,0,0

Annoying question.. I am 4 months clean off subutex.  Found a small stash I thought I got rid of been using about 1mg no more than 2 times a week always on the same days no cheating.

"Uncontrollable restless arms at back end of 1mg taper?. 

Hey all - struggling a bit and begging for advice. Here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôve been at 1mg all summer but admittedly have messed around with other shit on the weekends (almost every weekend, actually). Stims like adderal and coke, a few MDMA rolls, 3 one-day relapses (blue 30‚Äôs) and some comedown meds like Ketamine and Klonopin when I was too worked up.

Strangely, my legs seem to be relaxed except for some sporadic hip thrusting (so embarrassing) as well.

"Suboxone, Opioids and Benzos. Hey y‚Äôall,

I‚Äôve currently been on 120mls of methadone for several years and I‚Äôm contemplating switching over to suboxone. Main reason being I can still use AND get high while on methadone, which makes it harder to say no and get completely clean. My understanding is that suboxone completely blocks your receptors to opioids, which makes using basically pointless, and could be another helper/benefit to getting of the dope, as opioids are my main DOC (Drug Of Choice). My question is.. I know using heroin, Fentanyl, oxy, and things likes percocets have 0 affect while on suboxone. I‚Äôm wondering is it the same for Benzodiazepines? I deal with social anxiety and occasionally I need an Ativan, diazepam or Xanax. Would those have 0 affect while on suboxone as well? Or is it different for Benzos appose to the opioids while on subs. I‚Äôm very aware of the risks involved in combining Benzos with methadone, I‚Äôve done it many times before in the past, but I don‚Äôt know how the process goes if I chose to switch to Suboxone.

"Thank You, Suboxone.. My addiction started 7 years ago at age 22. My attempt to quit started 3 years ago. I would go 14 days, relapse. 30 days, relapse. Then I found Kratom. It allowed me to hit my longest streak - 60 days - but then, yup, relapse.

2 years ago I went overseas for 4 months to get clean. I felt great sober - back to my old, laughing, smiling self. 4 months clean! Yet I relapsed a week after coming back.

Fast forward a year of using, my parents found out (again). Send me abroad again (Middle East). This time she begged me to see a specialist. I was reluctant. I knew what he was going to do - put me on Suboxone. I thought to myself, ""Why would I get on suboxone, considering I'm already a month clean?"" 

Then I realized why. The relapses. The going to work in Withdrawal. The embarrassment of my boss finding me nodded out at my desk. The trust I lost with my parents, my brothers, myself. The complete stall in my career. The $12 in my bank account, when I was making $800 a week. The waking up in misery. That deep, dark, gut feeling that withdraw is coming. So so many reasons.

I saw the doctor in May and began Suboxone, along with therapy. A month later I flew back home. This time I was stronger, thinking clearer. I'm happy to say it'll soon be 8 months away from Heroin & Oxy. I turn 30 next week, so I'm happy to leave the drug use in my 20s.

I'm not sure I would have done it without Suboxone, & the lessons of therapy. I owe my life to this medication. I have thousands saved, not working yet but studying for my Internal Audit certificate. Something I would have NEVER done during my usage. So, thank you Suboxone. Really. I'm doing so much better.

"Just started, advice needed re: taper and best path to getting clean. Coming from a fent addiction. I was in cold turkey withdrawal for 5 days before finally getting to the ER and getting some suboxone 3 days ago. 

Currently I can get by on less than one 8mg tab a day. If I disciplined myself I could probably do 4mg/day although it would be a bit uncomfortable. 

I'd love to taper off this stuff asap but I'm wondering if that might be a bad idea. I read about one person who was doing a rapid taper and thought they were doing great until they suddenly weren't. 

Also the advice I was given was that I should switch from suboxone to kratom because kratom is easier to taper off of than suboxone. Any thoughts on that?

"Throwing up after taking my strips question. I‚Äôve been on subs for about two years now and recently have gone down from 3 8mg films a day to 1/2 strip a day (tapering with my doctor). I took a full strip today because my cravings have been worse the past few days. I haven‚Äôt eaten today and have had nicotine pouches in all day, which is why I threw up I‚Äôm sure. I threw up about 15 minutes ago, not fun but whatever, I should have eaten something. My question is, after 4-5.5 hours after taking them, did they have enough time to pass the blood brain barrier and remain effective even though I threw up? I just don‚Äôt want to start feeling poorly if they didn‚Äôt absorb into my bloodstream. Pretty sure it will be fine and they had enough time but just figured I‚Äôd ask.

"Am I being scammed by this doc?. I am a suboxone patient to a local addiction psychiatrist and I used to see him once a week for $80. He does not provide the medication- just a prescription. It is an outpatient office with just him serving as doctor and reception. He always charges the credit card I have put on file $80 for each appointment, either during or soon after the appoinment. After a few months, he offered to see me once every two weeks instead of one. When I left my first biweekly appointment, he charged me $160. I asked him why he did that and he texted back and said ""It was for two weeks instead of one."". In my intital reading of the situation, I see this as BS. We are in a rural area with not many options for suboxone doctors. In the dozens of the doctors I have ever been to, I have never been charged except for by-appointment, and by-procedure. He does not provide medication and is not inpatient, which are the only two situations in which I can imagine being charged weekly. It is also by appointment only, so it's not like its a drop-in place I am paying for access to. Is this man taking advantage of former addicts who are now addicted to suboxone or is there something I don't know? This doctor used to practice in California and now practices here. I have now texted him and said ""Oh so its not per appointment?"" and have heard nothing back. I would have appreciated him making this policy very clear before going ahead and making a 160 charge since it is so unusual.Thanks for any advice or input or knowedge you may have about this.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"TELEMEDICINE PROVIDERS. Hey y‚Äôall. I was hoping for some help finding other possible telemed providers for my state. I used to live in California where there were plenty of options for MAT, including several doctors to choose from in the area on top of telemed options. Now I live in Iowa and there are no buprenorphine practitioners near me what so ever, except for at the methadone clinic with extremely difficult intake and where they make you come in every day to get your dose of subs which is ridiculous. 
I made an account with QuickMD but when I go to make an appointment they have zero available options come up no matter how far out I set the date. I‚Äôve done bicycle health once before but they‚Äôre a bit on the expensive side for self-pay and they aren‚Äôt open on weekends. And after some research I found Bupe.me, Ophelia, workithealth, and pursue care but they are all not available in Iowa !! Does anyone know of any other options I can look into? Preferably somewhere that takes insurance or if it‚Äôs self-pay I‚Äôm looking to pay less than the 200$ it costs at bicycle.

"Concerned about my girlfriend. Hi all, I've been dating someone for 8 months. She has a history  of heroin addiction and has casually used lots of other drugs in the past as well. I don't have any history with drugs so this is all sort of new to me. 

A little bit more context:

She used heroin for probably 4-5 years. Went to rehab and got clean, then had a relapse a year or two later and went back to rehab. She tells me she has been completely clean (from heroin) since. This all predates me, so I'm a little fuzzy on the exact lengths of time. 

She's also told me that she has done mushrooms/weed/cocaine/and various other party drugs in the past, but never had much of a problem with them. IE would do them at parties, but never developed any sort of addiction.

Also, (and I'm not sure if this is relevant or not) about 2 years ago she spent some time in the hospital for fungal meningitis, and about 4 months ago she had to go back to the hospital because she had developed hydrocephalus as a result of the meningitis she had years before. She was prescribed diamox, which she takes daily and seems to at least alleviate her headaches enough for her to function pretty normally throughout the day.

Recently, I'm concerned that she is abusing suboxone. I found out that she has been having a friend send her pills for the past few months (at least) and has been taking them behind my back. When I confronted her, she of course lied at first but then admitted to it and said she only takes it because it helps with her headaches when they get too bad, and doesn't get a prescription for it because it's too expensive. I also have reason to believe that she is shooting it and not taking it as a pill. I've noticed new marks on her arms appear and I overheard her mom upset with her for finding a syringe. I haven't asked her about that yet. Also, in the past couple months she has had a couple episodes of really heavy, uncontrolled shaking and her being extremely cold, and then having what appears to be a fever afterwards. She's told me the doctors don't have an explanation for what it's happening and that it's just a result of her hydrocephalus, but I feel like it has something to do with her being on subutex now because it didn't start happening until she started taking that.

&#x200B;

I know this is a lot, but if you're still with me I have a couple questions:

1. Is it possible to shoot subutex, if so, how does she do it? (sorry I'm new to all of this) What are the associated dangers?
2. Is it possible that she could be using subutex for headaches like she says, or is it more likely she using it because she is feeling the urge to use heroin again?
3. What is the right thing for me to do? I know me getting mad at her and trying to take them away from her is only going to drive her to be more secretive, but I'm not sure how to handle this in a way that would make her want to be more honest with me and want to quit all of this. 

Any advice or words of wisdom are greatly appreciated.

"To Jump, or not to Jump.... THAT.. is the question... =)

This is almost silly, but I‚Äôm sure you guys get it. 
I‚Äôm very knowledgeable about opioids, the addiction, and the withdrawal. I‚Äôve been around here from time to time giving others advice on getting clean...

The thing is, when it comes down to giving myself the advice, it just feels like a conflict of interest. 
I had 5 years clean from the big H, but i herniated a disk and relapsed. The pain was terrible, I couldn‚Äôt seem to get relief from doctors, their cortisone shots, and the opioid crisis made them look at me and treat me awfully. 

I‚Äôve been on 16mg of suboxone now for over a year? I‚Äôve lost track, and I‚Äôm starting to really wish to be off it, but that‚Äôs complicated. I worry my back pain is there waiting for me. Sometimes it still rears up, and quite possibly I‚Äôm not having to feel it because I take subs. I also still get this crazy wtf-pain in my left testicle. Doctors and urologists dismissed me, thought I was drug seeking even when I flat out said, ‚ÄúI DONT WANT ANYTHING. I WANT IT FIXED!‚Äù and told me it‚Äôs ‚Äòvericocele‚Äô and I‚Äôm going to have to deal with it. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt usually hurt‚Äù they say as they look at my swollen junk. Thanks, opioid epidemic. Thanks ridiculous hysterical urologist. Can you believe I turned down drugs from this guy, literally asked him to cut off my ball, and he was a dick to me? 

There is the benefit of having that constant safety net. I see a counselor, I have a dying/dead 8 year relationship, but I am starting to feel like I‚Äôm not myself. At first it was nice having that little boost, and those filled receptors. I still get it sometimes. It was nice having my more negative moods and emotional tendencies blunted, but I‚Äôm starting to realize I may just feel all around flat; always in neutral.

I used to be against MAT until I relapsed, and needed it to keep my life together. I had gained too much ground to keep failing at cold turkey. When I finally committed myself to it I felt converted. In a way I still do think it‚Äôs probably the safest bet, but I also think this growing uncertainty will do just that.. continue to grow.

I am having a hard time getting really zealous about committing to going down though. I‚Äôm scared of going back to the state I was in when I was trying to get clean before this; taking subs, trying to stop, and then doing both subs and heroin. Things get crazy when you‚Äôre in that stage. It‚Äôs a ...transition.

Would anyone mind sharing their motivations and experience if they‚Äôve been through something similar? I am sort of feeling like if I have to take anything for the back pain I am capable of having from this herniated disk issue, then I‚Äôd prefer that it‚Äôs this. I tried gabapentin and all that type of stuff. For stupid addict reasons and just the way it affected me... I much prefer opioids. They work. I don‚Äôt have seizures if I run out, I just feel like hell.

Should I just count my blessings and not get too deep thinking about it? I think I‚Äôm capable of doing that. Sometimes I have these stupid thoughts like, what if something terrible happens and I suddenly can‚Äôt get my medicine, what if the apocalypse happens... I can get this done now and be good! Really, stupid, catastrophic what-ifs.. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs unique to me. Sometimes like I mentioned I feel like I‚Äôm not myself anymore. Like I‚Äôm just...coasting through life... the absence of overly negative thoughts and feelings that come with addiction really has a way of making me feel like a zombie.

Okay, sorry for talking too much. I just know how the posts like this often end up in requests for more details. You can‚Äôt help if you don‚Äôt have a big, candid, embarrassing picture. There it is.

"Killer migraine. I started suboxone 3 days ago.

"Suboxone for acute pain?. Hs anyone upped their dose for a couple days for the sole intent of having it help with acute pain following a medical procedure?  Or, have you gotten off if it and used them for a couple days only for a pain reason? 

I just had a medical procedure and the 5mg Percocets I was prescribed just aren‚Äôt hacking it for the pain I‚Äôm in. I got off my Suboxone three week ago to do all I could to ensure the post-op pain control was manageable. They wouldn‚Äôt give me anything stronger than 5mg Percs and said if I needed stronger to defer to the Suboxone doctor who of course won‚Äôt write my narcotics. She suggested I stop 48-72 hours prior to procedure but I highly doubt that would‚Äôve been sufficient. She also said if I took a whole 8mg strip it would probably be a decent replacement for other opioids. 

I really didn‚Äôt want to get on them again but if I‚Äôm out of the Percs and still in pain I would be willing to use them a day or two, especially if someone here can validate that it‚Äôs an option that can and will work. 

Lastly, if I use them for just two or three days will it retrigger withdrawal symptom and be a step backwards for me with just finally being able to get some sleep after three weeks of extreme insomnia brought on my getting off the Suboxone.?

"MY PAWS touching Subs. I‚Äôm a little confused how long subs stay or proverb withdrawals before they come back.

Since March 13 I have been sick in withdrawals and in bad PAWS non stop until last Saturday night when I got 8MG.

"Sublocade taper. I've had several hundred patients taper off buprenorphine over the past 15 years -- most after at least 3-5 years on the medication.  Most have done well, but now and then I'll read or hear about a death by overdose of a former patient.  Tapering is possible, but it isn't for everyone.

Lately though I've been using Sublocade as a 'last shot and done' approach.   If you look at the data, it looks promising.  I wouldn't recommend it for people who are still taking over 8 mg per day, because you would need 300 mg of Sublocade to avoid withdrawal the first month, and the drop-off in blood levels is steep enough to cause withdrawal after a few months...  but when a person is down to 4 mg or less, I can give about 50 mg of Sublocade, which then tapers itself over a year.   Studies of higher doses show the blood level constant for about 8 weeks, then gradually falling to zero at about 52 weeks at a constant rate of decline.

"3 days, 19 hours, 19 minutes. My symptoms have gotten a bit worse since my last post, which I wasn‚Äôt all that surprised about.

This may not work for everyone, but it‚Äôs a lot harder to talk myself into taking something when I see I‚Äôm less than 6 hours away from 4 days. That will be the longest period I‚Äôve gone without taking some form of opiate in six years, and that‚Äôs monumental to me.

Marijuana has been helping with this, as it feels like a light buffer and a distraction, and it has helped with getting to sleep‚Äîbut only for 2-3 hours.

First, they took like 5 days to send in my script after I've been using them for months...not cool with a drug that makes you sick when you don't have it.

Secondly, my pharmacy (walgreens) has said that they will no longer accept prescriptions from the provider out of Johnson City TN.

my other option was to switch over to kratom (if it will even help with the wds at all) for a couple days then hop on the subs, as I don't know what these are pressed with and I've heard the norfentanyl metabolite can cause issues for days but idk if that's gonna be a problem or not as I don't know the analouge and how it metabolites.

"Some philosophy from my doctor. Hello to all sub warriors here.

Here is some question that I was asked to think about and not to rush with answering to neither doctor and myself - but to think about it and came to some conclusions that we will discuss on next session.

If you get releive for your sub dosage (no matter how much you take) - what is broken when that pill helps you getting things fixed.

So, to get simple - can you find something that real life can give you to get happiness and relief like you get from taking your pill every day.

I'm still thinking and it's most basic things that came to my mind (family, kids, job, etc...) but I would like to hear from you girls and boys.

Can you imagine thing or two that can provide you that kind of relief and happiness?

"Day 21 off subs! I need help with how to start tapering the last of my kratom and gabapentin. So I've been on subs for 5+ years. Don't know the exact date (denial) 
It's been hard even though I have been taking kratom since I jumped, and I was able to get some gabapentin and have been taking it the last few days.  
It works a lot better than kratom. If I had a lot, I would much rather take it. I think my kratom is probably not the highest quality. But it does help with my Restless body and legs.  Not sleep, though. I'm up all night. 
The thing is, I do not have a lot of either (gabapentin/kratom) left and will not be able to get any more. Which is good because I know I can't rely on it forever. 
Can someone help me figure out how to properly dose and start the tapering process of both gabapentin and kratom? My brain isn't fully functioning.  I just need help. 
Also, I'll add I was on about 8mg a day. But the last 15 days before I jumped, I was taking 16mg. (I know stupid but I just took a nibble here and there and ran out 15 days after I got 30) 
Tapering wasn't an option.  I've wondered at my lowest times if I should just get back on it and do a proper taper.  I know that I do not have the will power, though.

can anyone speak to if this might work? or what my options might be?

"I need some help with dosing. A little backstory: I have extreme chronic pain, and where I live pain medicine is controlled and so there are no doctors who will prescribe me anything for pain, which is frustrating. 
Anyway, I found a guy who has been selling me percocets for the last 6 months and I have been taking about 6 a day, sometimes more depending on how bad my pain is. The guy who provided them doesn't have anymore at the moment and I am suffering from withdrawals. The guy gave me Suboxone and said it helps with withdrawals, but the thing is he said he has no idea how much or how often I should take them and because this is the first time I have heard of this stuff, I'm kind of afraid of taking them especially since I don't know how much to take or how often to take them. 

So my questions are, what's the starting dose of this stuff? How often should I take them? How do I ingest it, do I swallow them? I thought I read somewhere you put them under your tongue, is this true? He gave me 2mg and 8 mg pills. Is that too much or too little? How long after my last percocet dose should I take it? My last percocet dose was 18 hours ago and I feel awful, and it will only get worse, right?  
I'm so torn on what to do. On one hand I want this crappy feeling to go away now, but on the other hand I'm too afraid to take something foreign to me that has never been prescribed.

told I'm refilling to early wondering if you always wait till day you're out to fill. I should technically be out of my subs tomorrow. I filled them the 1st of July I  got 28 strips im now out. My doctor knows I take a little more than prescribed here to there. The reason for my post is I was reading that people usually can get them 2-3 days before they run out. My script would equal tomorrow that I would run out. I take 2x 8mg strips daily but sometimes I cut off some of the 3 rd one depending on how I feel. The pharmacy when I called today said tomorrow I can get them because that would equal the 14 day supply. Just curious is there a reason why some pharmacy allow early refills and some don't? I did learn my lesson about having back ups now.  My doctor said she would have prescribed me a higher dose but because I drink didn't think it was a good idea.

Question about inducing suboxone. First time taking suboxone the transition was easy I felt 100% better 30mins after I took the subs . I was taking much  less though I was taking about 100 mg. I am currently taking about 500mg daily . I tried to make the switch about a month ago and I was wd even after I took the subs . I made it about 3 days then just got back on the oxy because I still felt the wd . It got a little better day by day but I had to work and I couldn‚Äôt show That I was wd so I ended up getting back on oxy . Why did the subs work 30mins after I took it the first time but not work this time ? I started with 2mg then kept redosing every couple hours but it didn‚Äôt help much . What can I do to smoothly switch over like I did the first time ? The oxy I take is 100% real oxy . Open to all tips and advice !,0,1,0,1,0,0

"A year off subs. So technically it‚Äôs not a year until May 8th, but it‚Äôs been 359 days according to my app so I‚Äôm rolling with it. Jumped off from 2 mg after a few years stable there. It was hard. The first month was pretty miserable. I had restless legs, body aches, diarrhea, and the worst for me was the constant sweating. It took about 6 months for me to stop feeling like my armpits were sort of soggy all the time, it drove me up the wall. 

But here I am, having gotten through it. In this year I had my wedding, bought our first house, got a new job, our son turned two, and I‚Äôm now 6 months pregnant with our second little boy. It‚Äôs pretty wild to think about how I got here when a completely opioid-free life felt so out of reach a few years ago. 

I do feel like my life is sort of boring sometimes. It‚Äôs pretty much the same as it was on subs, but the subs gave me enough of a boost I guess to ignore it. I mean I‚Äôm a working mom of a toddler, so a lot of my life is going to work, changing diapers, cleaning the house, normal boring person stuff. But I still wouldn‚Äôt trade it for going back on subs or anything harder.

Doing so I stopped going to the clinic which got me off 130mg methadone which is the only positive here I suppose, so heroin is more or less acting as the bridge here.

Update 3.0: Everything worked out perfectly with the at home induction. Still adjusting the right dose but more than likely stay on a low dose. I want to say that if anyone is struggling with opioid use disorder and want to try suboxone for treatment then give quick.md a try if you don't want to pay the high prices of a clinic and don't want to drive anywhere to get help. The prices for treatment are reasonable and I haven't had any problems with the cvs pharmacy that I went to. Your miles may vary though but my experience so far has been a breeze. Doctor was nice too.

Pre-Treatment: 
Needing desperate help in finding out about other people's experiences with telehealth for getting on suboxone. Which one did you use and prices. I had planned on using quick.md the other day but when I went to make the appointment there was only 1 doctor available for my area, 1 !!! And to make matters worse my bank card didn't go through because the deposited check has to take 24 hours. But today my funds are available but that one doctor now only has a opening for June 24th. Which is too long of a wait for me. 
So does anyone on here know of and has experience with telehealth suboxone treatment and which company, pricing and procedures. I need to know for the State of Missouri. I only found so far using google quick.md, recoverydelivered, brighthearthealth, e-psychiatry. 
And the reason if anyone wants to know is because I've been an addict since I was 12 and now 40 years old. Got into pain killers about 2010 and lasted a year, heavy use. Fast forward to 2016 and started kratom all the way to present day but also been using pain killers again for about 6 months. I've tried to quit about 8 or 9 times so far and was semi successful twice but only made it to the 53 day mark and then 31 day mark give or take a few days as the paws is too unbearable. I'm sick of living like this and would like to give suboxone or buprenophine a shot. It seems alot of people have success with it as long as they stay on it.

"8 weeks off Suboxone & today I went to New York City. It has been 8 weeks since I got off Suboxone. For 4.5 years, I was just a person existing in the world. I didn‚Äôt leave home. I didn‚Äôt leave the couch. I missed some of the biggest events in my best friends life during those years and I‚Äôll never be able to relive it. It was rare for me to even shower as gross as that is/sounds. The only reason I left home was to see my psychiatrist and go to the pharmacy to pick up my suboxone. 

While the last 3 weeks were rough and this past week I‚Äôve had to take 5mg Oxycodone once or twice a day for my back pain, I‚Äôm doing so much better. As the title says, I went to NYC today! I took the train in with my brother and met up with my dad, his wife and my aunt. We learned how to make pizza. My dad and I made ours together and it turned out delicious! Also, I had never met his wife. My dad had an affair with her and broke my mom to pieces. I have talked to his wife on the phone and FaceTime but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to meet her in person. I have always felt as if I was betraying my mom who did NOTHING wrong for my dad to have this affair and lie to my mom (and me and my brothers) for soo many years. I also didn‚Äôt want to meet his wife and have my mom be at home alone knowing where I am and who I‚Äôm meeting. My moms my best friend and I tell her everything so it has just been very hard to meet get the courage to meet his wife. Her and my dad moved away in March and they were here to pack up their house as it had finally sold and that‚Äôs why we met up today (Saturday). It went great. I really like his wife. I did my best to make her as comfortable as I could because I didn‚Äôt want this to be a big deal. I had her take a picture with me and we all took a group photo as well that I forced her in to bring apart of. My dad has changed a lot and I actually felt more uncomfortable with him than I did his wife.

"Suboxone & oral sex while pregnant?!?!. My daughter just called me to ask if I thought it was possible to pass suboxone to another person via oral sex because she was feeling sick after her husband went down on her shortly after taking his suboxone & thanks to google I found a post on here from someone who asked the exact same question after feeling dizzy, nauseous etc after her boyfriend went down on her so we are pretty sure thats what happened to her, the problem is she is 9 months pregnant so now we're worried about type of effect the drug might be having on the baby. I'm assuming only a small amount of the drug was passed to my daughter but any amount is too much for the baby & everything we read talks about babies going thru withdrawals so we wanted to know if anybody else may have went thru the same thing & if so was the baby ok?",0,0,0,0,0,1

Getting off suboxone. I have gone from 6-4mg past 2 weeks. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs why I have been bloody hysterical in combo with other things. Has suboxone in general known to make people edgy at all? I haven‚Äôt had a very enjoyable experience on it the more I look back. I am looking forward to getting off it. I have a new doctor who seems really helpful he says when I decide to go down again I will go down by 1mg and not 2. I am 5 weeks pregnant and would like to get off it.. but yeah today I feel like a sense of peace somewhat. Also does suboxone tend to give people more energy or decrease one‚Äôs energy?

"Tricuspid valve replacement...anyone?. So, I'm having a problem and I'm trawling the recovery subs too, looking for anyone else that can relate. 

Last spring, I'd almost died. Had endocarditis,  MRSA pneumonia,  septic arthritis and discitis.  I went into full septic shock- multiple pulmonary  embolisms, blood sugar of 369, BP 70/30, fever for weeks that stopped out around 104¬∞F. I was lifeflighted and hospitalized for two months,  had to do PT/OT to stand/walk/function again. During my hospitalization and convalescent care,  I received close to 30 RBC blood transfusions for severe anemia (H/H of 3-4.0) as well. 

That was last March.  I came home end of May. However , ever since my hospitalization I have this cycle of feeling fine for about two weeks,  then I am hit with exhaustion like a ton of bricks and sleep for 2-4 days straight no matter how hard I try not to. Likely I need a valve replacement,  but I finally just got clean and on subs about 8 weeks ago.

Has anyone here had similar health issues and subsequent exhaustion?  

I am having much difficulty getting anything done ( still haven't followed up with PCP- at ALL, and am missing 2/3 days of outpatient every 3rd week or so). I am really beating myself up about it too. I feel lazy and useless. I also have a severe cold intolerance as well (H/H is normal though around 10-12) so I'm finding even leaving my house to be trying as well now.

Anyone who can relate or make suggestions, I'd be greatly appreciative.  Feel free to DM me if you prefer. TIA


Edit to add: Endocarditis is very closely associated with IDU (IV Drug Use).  80% o the tricuspid valve infections, as opposed to  the mitral,aortic... occurs in IDUs. Basically,*  if you  get endocarditis and have tricuspid damage, its 8/10 chance you're an IDU.*

I'm on bupe following a lengthy IV heroin addiction.  Since it's hard to keep tabs on your health when you're in active addiction, or really know how you're affected physically once drugs are taken off the table, I figured that a suboxone sub (a sub sub lol) would give me a good shot, no pun intended , at finding IDUs  who are in recovery and on bupe mmt  following an Opiate Use Disorder.

TLDR; 80%of  endocarditis infections resulting in tricuspid damage are a result of shooting drugs. So I contest that this is a better place than an open ask docs type forum for 'normies'",0,0,1,0,0,0

"Contemplating QuickMD very soon and looking for some quality info.. I‚Äôve just recently came across the absolute maaaive amount of sub/bupe help that has popped up in recent years with the likes of QuickMD and Bupe, and am seriously considering going this route. I have family/friends who have done the whole physical appointments and all that comes with it. At least for everyone I know going this route, they are paying outrageous prices. 

I am really interested in giving QuickMD a go, even as early as by next week, but just wanted some general info if anyone cares to give. 

I do have a dilemma, that I have not been able to find a solid answer or solution to. I live in a state that isn‚Äôt supported by QMD(Mississippi), but literally 15 miles from Alabama. I do have family that reside in Alabama, which could be an address if I need it. And if I can get around this, what about the pharmacy? Does it matter where I choose to set up my prescription? The area in Alabama that I speak of is so rural that even a decent pharmacy is in MS. 

I‚Äôm open to all responses. My main issue is a financial one. Most docs around here charge 300-500 a visit, do no take insurance, and cause a lot of people to resort to selling  just to afford their visit. As helpful as it has been for me, I just cannot justify that kind of cost.  Subs have truly gotten my life back on track and I just feel these telehealth alternatives could offer me the chance to truly have some routine and it be legal at that.

I'm in pain management for past 4 years due to multiple spine issues and my Dr decided that the morphine sulfate was not being absorbed very much so we decided to try other long acting meds. I have been on percocets 10 mg for the entire time save for the initial b.s. stuff like anti-inflammatory meds which did nothing.  

Anyways, after taking subs 2vmg sublingual for 2 weeks, my gums began to bleed and I'm a dedicated flosser after getting 2 high as a cat's back expensive crowns to go w my other 2.

"Boofing Subutex as harm min. Finally had the courage to risk wasting a day's dose to try boofing to get away from sniffing/snorting/insuflation. It worked.

1 x sl tablet crushed and dissolved in approx 1 - 1.5 ml hot water. Used a medicinal syringe approx 2 inches into batty whilst lay on left side. Pushed plunger as slowly as possible. Lay still for 10 mins and scrolled fb, then got up and went about my day. Felt it after about 20 mins - full effect approx 60 mins.

I started to snort as sl method took a long time (60 mins under tongue) of not being able to speak or eat/drink each morning. Also my teeth started to hurt. So, I crushed then and snorted. Worked great, but ruined my nasal cavities, and nose was running all day long and was getting synus type headache pain, every day. 

So, in short, for those who have gotten used to higher BA and faster onset of action from sniffing and don't have the patience or the inclination to go back to sitting still, being a mute for an hour every morning, there we are.

"Any Help In Buccal Administration of Suboxone Film. Hello! I've been on buprenorphine maintenance for about two years now and only a few days ago I finally decided to try and stick one 8mg film in the back between the gum and cheek and one 8mg under the tongue as normal and WOW I've never had any effects like it from my 16mg dose of Suboxone before! The effects are at least three fold but the onset of full effects seems to be a bit slower for some reason.

My only problem is that the film tends to get stuck on the finger when trying to get in place, and if you don't get it in the first try it starts rapidly liquefying on my finger and it sucks if I mess up part of my daily dose. I know films are not originally made for buccal administration, but that way I can actually get some resemblance of a kick and think that it's not a bad thing to get to enjoy your medication once in a while and get the most of it, instead of increasing the dose for example. Especially when it is the only thing keeping me clean from other shit...

Any tips how to get it all the way down there without the film getting stuck to what ever it is used to put it in there? Anybody had the same problem before? I know there's a ton of film users out there and I thought some of you had to have the same experience from buccal vs. sublingual admin...

"Have you ever had these side effects from Suboxone?. I've been on Suboxone for nearly 6 years, and I really want to get off of it. My life is going fine, but I feel like it could be going a lot better without them. There are a few ailments that I have, and I'm not sure if they are due to Suboxone or something else. Has anyone ever had any of these things from Suboxone?

1. Introversion. While I've always been the loner type, I feel like I've been more introverted than ever these past 5-6 years or so. I might go out with friends once per week, and I never want to. I spend 99% of my time in my room, working on my business. If I have to go out later in the day, the thought of it ruins my whole day until it's over with.
2. For  men - while we know Sub greatly lowers sex drive, has Sub ever caused you to have problems ejaculating? My semen is very chunky and globular, and this chunkiness causes pain and ruins the sensation. I'm wondering it this is because I only ejaculate a couple times per week due to the lowered sex drive?
3. No energy or desire to exercise. I used to be addicted to the gym and diet. It was a huge part of my life. But nowadays, I eat terribly and lifting is the last thing I want to do. I can't tell if this is due to my age (35), or Suboxone.
4. Very dark thoughts at night and in the morning. At night, sometimes I will just think of how scared I will be once my loved ones die. It terrifies me that it might put me in a depressed state and cause me to turn to drugs again. Once my Sub starts working in the morning though, I am fine.

I used tramadol for maybe 3 years then I switched to suboxone that I took for 1 years (24 mg daily).  


At the beggining of the years I started a tapper and I'm now taking about 1.3 mg daily.  
It was very hard to reach this amount and it's seems to get harder and harder everyday.  
I started using weed like 10 days ago and it's helping me with the withdrawal but it's getting so hard that I'm looking for any other think that it can help.  


I would like to ask for some advice/feedback about using Kratom to help quiting suboxone.   
I read a lot of posts about Kratom and read some positif feedback as well as negative one.  


I'm really not sure if it's a good idea to try it and how to use it properly, I'm really phisicaly and mentally exhausted by the tapping, so I'm kinda despair to find something else that can help.  


As I'm using 1.3 mg of sub currently, do you think I sould use a small amount of kratom and reduce a bit faster suboxone? or should jump to maybe 0.7 mg and using more Kratom to help or stop using sub and used Kratom instead?

I‚Äôve felt for a long time like I was put on this earth to show other people true genuine love and they are here to teach me self love. 

I‚Äôm always picking myself up off the floor, telling myself we are gonna get through this & that i actually am OK. But nobody else that loves me seems to be able to do anything but pity me. And them feeling sad just makes me feel sad and I‚Äôm writing this post so that anyone who might have the right words to say‚Ä¶ will say them. Be gentle.. I am fragile.

I just want someone else to give me the attitude I should have about this. Or the one I want. I match energy & I need someone with good vibrations.

I've been on subs for almost 2 years taking at first 4mgs and then the last year upped it to 8 because I was still in a addict mindset over the course or the year I finally tapered back down getting to 1mg. I wanted to taper lower but due to events in my life I had to make a choice and chose to cut it at 1mg(I do not recommend).After the first day wasn't bad but the next three were hell for me but by the start of the fifth day I started to settle and the physical symptoms were nearly gone except some nausea and RLS at night. I'm at day 7 almost 8 and just have felt much better. When I was at day 3 I kept reading people say this lasts for weeks and just be prepared for more severe symptoms and to be fair I assume it's true for different people but it almost made me jump. I wanted to bring a positive light to the situation.

"Wellbutrin and Suboxone. Hello. My doctor prescribed me 150mg/day of Wellbutrin 3 months ago. I got it filled and it's just been sitting in my medicine cabinet. I've been afraid to start it because I have a fear of starting \*anything\* I have to take every day and/or that I will potentially have to  wean off of at some point. This is due to my experience with opioid dependency. I've been in recovery for several years now with the help of Suboxone (about 4mg per day). I know it's probably an irrational fear, but I just don't like the idea of taking something that I'd have to wean off of.

HOWEVER, I've been reading a lot about Wellbutrin over the past few months and I'm beginning to consider taking it. I like the idea that it has helped many with irritability associated with anxiety, and although not labeled, many have said it has helped their libido. There are other reasons, but those are the top two that peak my interest. 

I have a low-dose Xanax prescription that I have in case of emergency (I rarely take it but there are times I need to for panic attacks and in cases where I feel consumed by anxiety). With that, it would be nice to have something that helps with daily anxiety.

"[Trigger Warning] Could the side effects of Suboxone be contributing to my worsening depression?. Hey guys. First and foremost I would just like to say that I am grateful for everyone here. Honestly, had I not found you guys my MAT Suboxone journey would feel much more isolating than it has been already. I am just really thankful for everyone‚Äôs advice and support. 


Okay, so...I have been on Suboxone (MAT) for 107 days- today. In the almost 4 months I have been on Suboxone maintenance my very severe clinical & often suicidal depression has gotten worst despite being in addiction treatment once a week, psychotherapy for mental health once a week plus regular check ins with my psychiatrist for mental health medication management. I don‚Äôt know what more I can do for myself help wise? I spend 97% of my time indoors without any social interaction mostly due to the other factors such as no energy & constant weakness. I have zero motivation to take care of my appearance & basic self care is out the window. I am not thriving in sobriety although sober! I see zero difference in my depression levels, motivation & overall well-being. The only difference is I am not chasing around a bag. I still very much look like I am on drugs. I feel hopeless. I have been like this for 4 years now, I started self medicating with prescription pain meds between 6-9 months after the depression I have until this day, set in. I started using due to depression & I quit using due to depression. My main motivating factors each time I have gotten clean in the last 4 years was my thought that if I could kick using then maybe I could get back to the person I was before depression came.. I thought maybe the depression had come & gone already & that it was just the drugs holding me back. I soon realize each time after sobering up that I am severely depressed either way. I would go as far to say that depression has taken a much bigger toll on my appearance than opiates even had the chance too...

You know how you see your old druggie   who kicked drugs, got into a program, started MAT & put on they adorable healthy weight since they have been clean? They practically glow & are always smiling ear to ear when you see them. At points even inspired you to fight for your own sobriety? 

Yeah, how come that never comes for me? If anyone here knew the person I was before my gradual depressive decline you would be shocked. For over 10 years I was an Norwegian-American runway model until I was 25 years old, about to finish my education when the depression set in later that year & I lost everything.

Has anyone else experienced this? Anyone else start using to self medicate suicidal depression? Does it get better? Do you or anyone else you know feel like Suboxone makes you feel sick & weak? Or that it directly contributes to worsening symptoms in patients with preexisting depression disorder?  I don‚Äôt really know where to go from here except for to eliminate Suboxone to see if it helps. I am so desperate to get some sort of quality of life back, some normalcy that I am not even interested in using drugs at all. I feel safe getting off after 4 months of Suboxone MAT. I am on 2mg/Day 3 & tomorrow I make another cut down to 1.5mg. My plan is to jump at .13 mgs. I am using the helpmegetoffdrugs.com taper method. Has anyone used this method or know anyone who has found success with it? 

I‚Äôm sorry about the rant & cry baby shit. I am no victim, I am just really depressed & it‚Äôs debilitating. I am really struggling internally & could use some support. As I don‚Äôt have support elsewhere. Thank you to anyone who made it this far. I would love to hear your stories of any kind!

"Unforeseen downside to using Vitamin C to eliminate my withdrawals. When I first posted how well pure Vitamin C powder worked for eliminating physical withdrawal symptoms. There was one gentleman who commented and said that he *needed* to experience the pain of the withdrawal process as it would later be the thing that would keep him from ever going back. I admired his strength and tenacity but I couldn't understand why someone would want to experience such horrific withdrawal symptoms if they didn't have to. I just couldn't understand it. But now, I do. 

I should start by saying that yes, of course Vitamin C powder does not work for everyone because nothing does. But it does work far more often than not if used in the right form (pure powder) and a high enough dose. For me it was an absolute Godsend. I tried and failed so many times before I discovered Vitamin C. I was on 24mg/day of Suboxone and I was able to rapidly taper all the way down to 2mg in just a few weeks and jump straight off from there with very mild discomfort. My prior attempts without Vitamin C were pure agony and I never made it past day 5. But with high/frequent doses of Vitamin C powder, 80% of my withdrawal symptoms (including RLS, extreme fatigue and cold sweats) would completely subside for a solid 4 hours until my next dose. 

By day 20 I was feeling better physically than I had during the whole time that I was on Suboxone. I was no longer taking the Vitamin C at this point because I just didn't need it. When my dose of Vitamin C would wear off and no withdrawal symptoms would creep up, that's when I knew I had fully made it through the physical aspect. 

By day 30, I don't think I had ever been more proud of myself. It was the very first time in my [adult] life that I was completely substance free. But mentally I was a wreck. I was so painfully depressed and could barely muster up the motivation to complete the simplest of tasks, like take a shower or make a cup of coffee. Physically I felt great but mentally I felt completely useless. After such an incredible accomplishment, I went and threw it all away by ordering some kratom online to help with my depression and lack of motivation. Before I knew it,I was redosing compulsively throughout the entire day and it only took a couple weeks until I was taking well over 20gpd and waking up in the middle of the night with RLS until I'd get out of bed and redose. I felt more trapped than ever and I felt so ashamed of myself for making it so far just to throw it all away. 

The complete lack of energy and motivation was what did me in. I felt completely useless and I was starting to fail at my business because I had no drive whatsoever. But in hindsight, I can see that I was so much closer than I realized. Had I just stuck it out after those first 30 days, I am sure that things would have only continued to get better and better from that point on. And by this time, I would be feeling better and stronger than ever. But instead I made a full 360 and am right back where I started. My kratom addiction became so out of hand and was wreaking havoc on my physical and mental health as well as having devastating effects on my appearance (extreme hair loss, deep wrinkles, muscle loss, etc) I was helplessly addicted and ultimately returned to Suboxone out of complete desperation. After 113 days of being completely off of it, here I am right back where I started. Talk about feeling defeated. 

My point is this, by using Vitamin C to make my withdrawal period easy and virtually painless, I was far less reluctant to throw away my progress. Vitamin C made it so easy for me to get off of Suboxone that I figured, what's the big deal if I have to start over again? And now I understand exactly what that gentleman meant when he said that he *needed* to experience the pain of withdrawal as it would later serve as his motivator to stay clean. I used Vitamin C powder and it made my detox a cake walk but in the end, is that truly such a good thing? Had I grit my teeth and sweat through weeks of sleepless nights to make it to 30 days, I'm quite certain I would have been far more reluctant to throw it away.

Anyways, I just wanted to share this experience 
because after wanting everyone to know how amazing and effective Vitamin C powder truly is, I felt obligated to share what was a truly unforeseen down side to making withdrawal ""easy"". No pain no gain I suppose.

"Questions about using Suboxone to help quit Kratom. TLDR; Kratom user for 4 years, many failed quits. Doctor has recommended to use Suboxone to help quit, but I see many folks saying to stay away. Experiences with this? Risks? Worth it?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for all the great comments! There were a lot so sorry if I haven't replied to everyone. There seems to be strong opinions on both sides of the argument. What I have decided is to take the middle road - I'm going to only take suboxone the first 2, maybe 3 weeks max, and the smallest amount possible (much less than what my Dr. is recommending), than do a taper for another 2 weeks off of it. I'm hoping this will help get me through my most fragile point of withdrawal, without becoming dependent on yet another thing. I will plan on posting an update in a few weeks (I'm planning to jump from the Kratom June 1st). Thank you for all the words of support!   


Hi friends - I won't get into my whole story but I'm currently taking a pretty high amount of Kratom built up over the past 4 years. I started taking Kratom for anxiety and never had any issues with any other substances. (\*Side note, I'd really prefer not to focus on arguing the merits of kratom, it, IS highly addictive and behaves the same way as other opiates, but I do realize it has helped many people come off worse things\*). I've tried to quit numerous times CT (tapering does not work for me), never made it past Day 16. I can easily get through the physical acutes, especially with some helper meds from my doctor, but it's always the anhedonia and empty feeling from PAWS that does me in, despite being on Celexa for a few years. I've also tried Naltrexone, that helped with cravings but I still couldn't handle the anhedonia that came along with it, especially since I am in a very demanding, creative field where I have to be on my A-game all the time.

Anywho - I have been discussing with my Dr. trying to use Suboxone to help quit this time. I understand how it works, that it is also an opioid that binds to the Mu receptors but she claims it cannot make me high, and will help me feel normal. When I ask her how long I will have to stay on subs, she never really gives a straight answer. My understanding is it's usually a very long term thing? I also see many of the horror stories on here of others in the process of trying to quit subs and that the WD's are much worse than kratom. BC of all this, I am a bit hesitant and afraid of trading one thing for another....it may be the lesser of two evils but it sounds like it will be just one more thing I have to quit in the future, and will not be allowing my brain to heal itself fully. I'd love to hear from you folks - What are your experiences with it? Does it help? How long were you on it, and what did you have to go through to quit suboxone? Were you able to successfully use it for just a very short amount of time? Do you get withdrawal from that and at what dosages/amounts of time? I'd love to hear your stories.

"Is it ever the right time to stop?. I‚Äôm questioning the value of maintenance against the side effects and beginning to question if I really ever ‚Äúneeded‚Äù it in the first place. 

To give you a l title context I will share the most current part of my story as it relates to getting on subs this time.  I spent most of 2018 in and out of county. Using heavily on the outside. Then December 2018 I got arrested and was in for about 6 months. Got out last summer and went to an intense long term women‚Äôs rehab. 

I graduated and moved into sober living. Did okay there for maybe a month then stared dabbling again. Fast forward a few months I ended up in the hospital w cellulitis in my arm from re using a needle. 

Went back to treatment for about a week. Realized there was no way I was going through that whole thing again when I already had all the information and was choosing to just be stupid. 

So I left treatment and sober living and moved in with my mom. I was having a lot of trouble at SL w other women constantly going in and out. That made staying clean infinitely harder for me. Once I moved home I used maybe 3-4x before I realized this was fucking ridiculous and really just got completely turned off at the whole idea of continuing down that road. 

Didn‚Äôt start subs right away. Maybe after a month or so because I ‚Äúfelt like I needed them.‚Äù  A lot of anxiety surrounding work etc. I only ever wanted to do the shot but my doctor is such a fucktard that‚Äôs happened once in the 3-4 months I‚Äôve been taking subs (the other times just being on strips) 

I‚Äôm taking strips now. I ended up leaving that job to work from home.  The stomach issues are just so fucking bad I feel like a goddamn balloon walking  around. When I started on them a few months ago I felt some Relief. Definitely a lot more even. 

But now I just feel sluggish. I have no desire to go get high again and now that I am working from home and stress levels have subsided immensely I‚Äôm just wondering if now isn‚Äôt the perfect time to call it quits. I would Taper of course. It just feels like time is of the essence as I‚Äôve only been on subs for a few months. 

In this time I have entirely stayed away from opiates. I did fuck around trying to shoot my subs for a short while until I was like wtf. Your so dumb. That‚Äôs been over. Also now that I am finally back at home the thought of going down that whole road again has absolutely 0 appeal. All those ppl are locked up. I‚Äôm so over it and ready to just get on with my life and be an independent adult. 

I‚Äôd rather get off now while I‚Äôm still freelancing and have the ability to work from home. I can continue doing this until I feel like I‚Äôm able to go back to work in an office job- that‚Äôs what I really want to do. Having the opportunity to take this time for myself has been so incredibly helpful. I‚Äôm very grateful for where I am today. I just know I‚Äôll only be postponing the inevitable by staying on and I‚Äôd very my like to leave this ‚Äòchapter‚Äô (I.e years upon years of my life) totally behind me.

"Gabapentin + clonidine is helping A TON with the detox process!. My story is a bit interesting. I was put on subs mostly because I was doing benzos for about two years.

Officially it says if I'm traveling with anything under the Opium Act I need a Schengen Certificate. 

Buprenorphine is under the Opium Act but I don't know if that still applies to suboxone as that's technically a different medication.

Some people say I need the certificate, some say just keep it in the bottle in my carry on, some say to get a doctor's note etc etc. I tried calling the embassy, no help. 

Can anyone who's traveled to Europe (or even better Iceland) tell me what your experience is? I'm paranoid of having something happen and lose my meds while I'm there. Talk about turning an amazing trip in to a nightmare.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Question, advice & discussion about doctors now that almost any can prescribe Suboxone. I don‚Äôt know why I feel so nervous to post this. I‚Äôm usually anxious to post anything in general but I hope my information is correct and my delivery makes sense. If not, please (kindly) educate me! TL;DR at the bottom. 

This January, there was a major shift in addiction medicine policy which awarded doctors more flexibility when it comes to prescribing Suboxone. Previously, as we all know, doctors had to undergo an 8 hour training and receive an ‚ÄúX-waiver‚Äù before they could prescribe Bupe. 

Now, my current psychiatrist is kind and I really like her however, a lot of her patients feel as though she uses the Suboxone program to make easy, quick money. When I first started going to her, she charged $150 per monthly visit and $180 every three months for UAs. 

Four months later, after the new year, she raised her prices to $170 per monthly visit and $200 every three months for UAs. I can afford this however, since the policy change, I‚Äôve considered asking my PCP whether or not he could take over my prescriptions in order to save money. Has anyone else done this?

My psychiatrist does not accept insurance. She also prescribes me the antidepressants my PCP formerly prescribed (when I told him I was seeing a psychiatrist, he said he would let her prescribe the antidepressants she found appropriate being it was more her expertise). 

I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has stopped seeing their psychiatrist or addiction specialist and instead begun receiving their maintenance med from their original PCP now that it‚Äôs easier for anyone to prescribe. 

Additionally, won‚Äôt psychiatrists like mine be forced to lower their prices and/or at least begin accepting insurance with the new policy change? I was fine with paying what I did/do because doctors with an ‚ÄúX-waiver‚Äù *were* uncommon in my area. Now that the license is essentially obsolete and unnecessary (from what I understand), wouldn‚Äôt this change the rarity, the demand and therefore be reflected in the pricing?

I know I could save *a lot* of money this way. Because of Covid, I have been using Skype for my monthly appointments. Every time we hang up, I see the duration of the call and realize I‚Äôm paying $170 to $200 to speak to someone for 3 minutes. 

My only concern with switching (which may just be my over anxious addict brain messing with me) is that I‚Äôm afraid my PCP will require me to do something extra and/or possibly begin to taper me sooner than I‚Äôm ready for. To be honest, my psychiatrist has never discussed tapering with me. On the contrary, she said it‚Äôs common for people to remain on Suboxone for life (to each their own - this is not something I am planning to do, though). 

Sorry for the lengthy post. TL;DR has anyone switched doctors since it became possible for almost all physicians to prescribe Buprenorphine?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Why ft is the Sub not working. Ok, here‚Äòs the short facts:

My habit was 0.3 - 0.5g Heroin through my nose or smoked, daily, for about half a year. 
It ended with a binge on monday. 

Tuesday, about 18 hours later when I was in WD I used 4mg Subutex. Didn‚Äòt give me lots of relief. 
Wednesday I felt quite hellish, So I took a whole 8mg. It gave relief, not 100%, but I was feeling ok. 

But now is the next morning, no 18 hours after I took those 8 mg, and I feel pretty bad again.

How could that be?

Subutex worked like a miracle drug last time I used it. And I needed much less.

EDIT: Yeah, so reading back the threads I created over the last three weeks made me realize what‚Äòs wrong hete. I‚Äòve been mixing all kinds of drugs INCLUDING SUBUTEX for several weeks now. No wonder nothing works. I will simply stop taking anything that is not OTC at this point and just ride it out in bed, hope I=ll be ok by christmas eve.

"I feel like its my last resort. I am not an opiate addict, but I for sure am an addict. I just finished a two month clean and sober inpatient rehab stay, came back and bought myself 100 10mg diazepams, and 16 x 8 mg Subutexes. I recently got off zoloft that I have been on for the last eight or so years (being on that is a story of its own) I am technicly not a opiate abuser by nature, I just noticed that Subutex is probably the best antidepressant I have ever tried.. I dont think its possible for me to live without nothing, and the only thing they will offer any addict is suboxone. What do you guys think, should I take the leap? Should I contact my doctor and request to be in LAR (The thing we call it here thats like drug assisted rehabilitation).

I am done with stims, but the depression, the anxiety, its killing me. If I hadnt taken any bubprenorphine today, I would just lie in bed all day, just try to sleep my life away, death being shy.

"Suboxone has turned into a money making machine for clinics. I've been off of Heroin for almost 9 years now. I couldn't stay clean, and was in and out of treatment. So I got on suboxone when I was 19. 

My first doctor was this old man who had his patient's come to his house. He charged $25 a visit, and I saw him once a month. He truly cared about me staying clean. However, after about two years of seeing him he retired. So he referred me to a local doctor he knew at a clinic. 

My second doctor was an older man too, and truly cared about my sobriety. The whole clinic did. They were all so nice and caring. I stayed with him for over 6 years. The last several I saw him once every 3 months and paid $100 for each appointment. So $100 every three months. He also put me on subutex so it was cheaper. I never failed a drug test and was his longest patient. He asked me to speak at a convention, but then covid hit. 

Earlier this year I was notified that he was also retiring. It was sad, but I understood. He gave me his personal email and told me to keep in touch. 

I was referred to this other clinic, and a couple of months ago started going. Right away I knew it was different. The staff was rude, and I didn't even see a doctor. Now they are letting PAs prescribe suboxone. They made me see them 4 times the first month despite me being clean for 8 years. And then every three weeks. Each visit costs $250. So my balance is already over $1000 in two months. I paid $400 a year at my other clinic. On top of that they are making me switch back to suboxone, which also costs more. 

I can't afford this. Today they said if I didn't pay in full by next visit I would be discharged. I feel like they are all about $$$. They couldn't care less about people's sobriety. They make me feel like I'm a piece of garbage. I haven't felt this way since I was using.

"Tapered down to .75mg.. I need some tips for anxiety and sleep!. So, basically what the title says. I have about four months left of subs at the current dose I‚Äôm at. I take the full dose in the morning, mostly because the pieces are getting so tiny (8mg strips) and by mid day my anxiety is sky high. My old doctor was monitoring it, but she‚Äôs a six hour ride round trip, so I had to stop going. Luckily I had a decent amount saved up and have been slowly decreasing in my own.

"Anyone here take medication for ADHD?. Hi. I have been on suboxone for over 4 years now and haven‚Äôt used since I began MAT. I was medicated for my ADHD for most of my childhood/ teenage years but stopped taking it around the time I started using. 

I have an appt with a psychiatrist next week and I was thinking of asking if I can go back on my old medication. I was on adderall XR 20mg. I was doing really good while I was on the medication. & lately I have zero motivation to do much of anything. I am a stay at home mom and my goal was to start taking classes online again when my kids got into a steady routine where I would have the time. Well now I have the time, but no motivation.

"Which is better?. I know all about the debate on using kratom to get off suboxone and how it's just trading one addiction for another. Be that as it may, which is the lesser evil of the two?

I know that kratom can also be addictive, but isn't it a natural product? What are the long term effects of kratom vs suboxone? If I'm going to be addicted to something, which one is worse?

And for those that say kicking kratom is the hardest thing they've ever done - were you also previously addicted to opiate pain killers or opiates/street drugs of any sort? If so - which was harder to get off of, subs or kratom?

I've been taking 4 mg suboxone 1 time per day for the last 4 years. Any time I went without, the withdrawals were unimagineable, with days 3-7 being the absolute worst. I found this thread and after reading the pros and cons, I decided to stop Suboxone and take kratom. I was honestly scared to death of withdrawals but I'm on day 4 of no suboxone and I'm absolutely amazed at how normal I feel. I am not feeling any withdrawal symptoms whatsoever. 

However, I'm not a fan of having to dose 3 times a day, I'm used to taking my 1/2 sub pill once a day and that's it so this is already becoming quite a task, and a messy one at that.

I would love to hear how others have gone through this.

Also, and this might be a silly question - if I were to decide to get back on the subs, will I experience the precipitated withdrawals?

I don't want another one. And the website says it's specifically for opiate addicts. I don't want to sit and talk about my addiction,  cravings, shit like that. I've maintained clean urine and sobriety for years. I contacted the receptionist who sent me the text, explaining I already have a therapist and if he's gonna require this, I'll have to find another doctor, and she wrote ""You can discuss with the dr at your appt"".. Then the next text was the fucking URL for the website again. I do NOT want to do this.
I guess my question is, do you think it's worth trying to explain to him why I'm not interested in a second therapist, or should I seek out a different doctor? The only thing is, I'm on Medicaid and he's one of the very few around here who accepts it. So I guess if you know any resources for where to find sub doctors who take Medicaid (I'm in PA), that'd also be helpful.

Thinking of switching to subutex. I‚Äôve been getting bad headaches from suboxone lately. I‚Äôm tapering down every week or two and I‚Äôm currently on 5mg a day.

"Do you prefer strips or pills? Strips feel inconsistent, and I'm considering switching to tablets. Any thoughts or experiences to share?. I have only ever had Dr. Reddy's generic strips and feel like they're inconsistent. Somedays, I am knocked on my ass, and others feel like I took nothing and get cravings. I'm looking for more consistency in my medication. Is this all in my head, or are some meds better than others? Any thoughts are welcome, and thank you in advance for your input.
EDIT: THE AMOUNT OF DOWNVOTES FOR ASKING QUESTIONS IS UNHELPFUL AND TOTAL GARBAGE. I talked to my doctor, and he AGREED that Dr. Reddy's strips are known for being inconsistent. We're going to make some changes for a more consistent experience.",0,1,1,0,0,0

"Suboxone Appt. Today- Advice needed. My husband has monthly Suboxone appointments with a Dr. to maintain his prescription. They have been going well- we always go together and generally enjoy them. There have been times where my husband has lied about attending meetings because in his past Suboxone treatment they really pushed it and he wasn‚Äôt sure if that would be the case here- I‚Äôve always encouraged him to be honest but felt that was harmless and never told the Dr. he hasn‚Äôt attended meetings. 

We have an appointment today- we meet there this afternoon. I know his sister has sent him pills but I don‚Äôt know when/if he will receive them AND I don‚Äôt know what they are- their past messages mentioned the term ‚Äòbars‚Äô and that they were laced with fentanyl‚Ä¶ I assume these are the same but I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶


If he gets them today- I‚Äôm sure he wont take any before the appt, but should I mention to the Dr that I know about this? I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll get called out on how I came across this info‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm worried he will confront him head on about this‚Ä¶ or do I wait until he seems high to loop the Dr in? The pills might not get delivered‚Ä¶

"Derealization / Nostalgia. During opiate withdrawals, I sometimes experience feelings of strong nostalgia and a feeling like ‚Äúeverything is new to me‚Äù. It usually occurs when I am feeling quite low and I am experiencing those first waves of withdrawals. It‚Äôs almost kind of a ‚Äúbeautiful dark‚Äù feeling.

example: I was walking around the city and withdrawing from my suboxone taper. My senses felt like they went a little bit in overdrive ‚Äî all of a sudden i could smell the hot, humid summer air combined with the smell of food from the street carts. I could hear the subway train pounding the tracks in the far distance. the sounds of kids playing in the street. Spanish music playing from the local bodega. It was all kind of beautiful and mystifying‚Äî kind of felt like I never experienced this moment before. Or maybe I did experience this when I was 4 years old?

all of this brought me back to past memories of me traveling to the city with my family and experiencing all of these newly discovered stimuli. Almost like to a time where I felt like the world was brand new and I felt safe and secure. 

My question is - does anyone else experience this during withdrawal? Although you feel awful, it‚Äôs a wonderful feeling (not to sound like i‚Äôm romanticizing this whole ordeal)",0,0,1,0,1,0
"Tapering -4 x a day dosing. Good morning, 
For anyone currently tapering on subs and doses more then 2x a day. 

I have been dosing 4 x a day for 3.5 years. 
I started like this because I was afraid to take it all in one shot in the beginning. And then I have  stuck with it since then. I have already decreased my does from 16 to 6mg film and I‚Äôm stabilizing until September.  But I‚Äôm still dosing 4 times a day
I feel fine, but I just want to make sure because I have other issues too. 

Should I just take away a dose for my next drop down?  
I know it‚Äôs hard to stop this type of schedule because my body/brain is used to it.

"Tapered down to .125mg (1/16 of 8mg) and jumped. Withdrawals kicked my butt. Hello everyone, recently over the last month I've been tapering down off my suboxone on my own since my sub doctor was literally no help at all. I figured I'd go all the way down to .125mg and jump off. Well 2 days ago was my last dose. Yesterday was kinda rough as I expected, mostly general fatigue was the biggest issue. Was only able to get 3 hours of sleep and today was about the same as yesterday until about 2pm when I started feeling like every single movement was like I was trying to walk through thick mud. Then the nausea set it. Wasn't anything extreme but no way I can function like that at work or do my fire calls. So today I diluted my suboxone solution even further so each dose is 0.03125mg  and took 1 dose. Now the nausea lifted a decent bit. I mean I don't feel fine either but I could function like this so that's all that matters to me because I'm coming off this poison SOON. I think I will do 0.0625 for maybe 3 days and try and jump again but if that doesn't work either then I will taper down to 0.015625mg and that should absolutely be low enough to jump off without being put out of commission",0,0,1,0,1,0
"Advice for 2mg --> 0mg taper. Hi guys. I have 2 months to do this. I need to be off this crap now.  I am struggling to keep my dose daily and keep ending up short at the end of the week. Half of me thinks I should just jump and suck it up. I want to get everything I need to get through WD. I was thinking some kind of benzos, zopiclone, muscle relaxant and possibly some modvigil/provigyl to deal with the energy side of things. If anyone from the uk can help me I would be grateful - my doctor prescribes 2, yes 2 zopiclone a month at most and is not interested in helping with anything else. I know it will suck as I have been in full WD in the last week and am just about holding out with OTC codeine and dihydrocodiende. Thanks James.",0,0,1,1,1,0
"Advice/Help needed urgently. Hi everyone,

I personally don't take opoids or suboxone and never have so I have zero experience with this. However I am facing a huge issue with my mom who is. 

my mom has been hooked on opoids for 10yrs+ and recently, 4 months ago, quit with the help of suboxone. 

She has cut her dose of sub down to a 1/4 pill per day (not sure the dose) and is losing her mind. 

She is convinced my entire family is out to get her and are putting cameras/recording devices in her attic. She claims to have videos of them but will never show me. She thinks everyone around her at work is a ""spy"" for the family etc. 

It is insane, I'm not sure how to deal with this. She seemingly trusts me, but just today I said ""hey maybe you should still be taking your full dose of suboxone"" and she lost her mind and said im one of them. 

Please, does anyone have tips or time lines on when she will stop being like this? Does weening off suboxone really make people crazy like this?!

Another note: she smokes a ton of weed, and is on 2 anti depressants as well as a strong blood thinner. I'm not entirely sure how those play a role as she only started acting like this since she started cutting the suboxone dose...

EDIT: thank you all for the input. we are trying to get her help and figure out how to get her in for a psych evaluation.",0,0,0,1,0,0
