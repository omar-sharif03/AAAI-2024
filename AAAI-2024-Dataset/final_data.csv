I do not have a script because I fear Suboxone being on my health records for the rest of my life. I am on approximately 2-3mg per day. Should be concerned? This is my first job in healthcare and I’m really looking forward to it.",['OTH'],0,0,0,0,0,1
2,ogldqw,"Realllly ready to get off this stuff, jumped down from 12-16 to 4-6mg. I've been on Sub strips for nearly a decade and I reallllly want to stop. I've never made it passed the 14 day mark. I haven't been off everything since my senior year in high school. I'm in my mid 30s now, I don't know if I even know who I am anymore some days. All I remember from those days is being so sick to my stomach most days in school, from stress alone. Then I was a social butterfly once I found hydros, all my symptoms disappeared. Fast forward 8 years I decided enough was enough and I got on Subs due to being broke, newly heartbroken, in jail, a complete mess. Now hear I am, a decade sober, becoming miserable as can be, more and more frequently. some days are pretty good thanks to family. Recently, in the last couple months, I've been battling with a seemingly randomly racing ❤, usually followed by awful anxiety or full blown panic attacks. Bouts of realllllllly bad depression, even though I know I should be happy. The only thing I seem to ""feel"" is numb, and in a brain fog that makes me even more anxious. 

So about 4or5 days ago I cut my dose down from 12-16mg too 4-6mg. 
I must admit I did feel alot better after day 2-3ish but I still don't like it. Every day is up or down from the last.... At least I can think a little more clearly. Seems like the sub has just flipped a switch on me.  Changed just as fast as my moods. I think it'll get better once I stable out some.

I was able to stay sober for over year had a lot of success because I went to therapy once a week and was in AA, As the suboxone is just a tool for me in my sobriety. My normal is dose is 8mg/day.  About the 10th month in we did blood work and it did destroy my testosterone levels and even after getting on a low dose of testosterone, I still had these issues:

-still low sex drive and blood flow
-after about 5 months of subs, my emotions became ""flat"" , i felt like my personality was dimmed down
- wasnt excited about much of anything
-  My ex girlfriend ended up going with another guy and my testosterone and emotions were so messed up I just didn't really care

 I got very impatient with the VA because they take forever to help with anything so I came off the suboxone for about a week and guess what I relapsed, did 30mg oxy for about 6 days. I'm not being too hard on myself as I don't feel I threw everything away because the quality of my recovery was very high so I'm going to immediately jump back. 

I just took 4 mg of sub this morning, no PWD. Going back to work. I feel fine again.

 I guess my main question is do you guys have any experience with this flat feeling, emotionless? Low sex drive?

Edit: For those that are interested in my progress, I figured I'd update:


I was on 12-16mg suboxone for around 2 years, with doses between that range during that time.

Things are going well. I had WD symtoms after the first shot beginning the 3rd day lasting another week at most, but I supplemented with Suboxone 4mg once daily during that period and I had no issues. Then all of a sudden I didn't need the extra suboxone dose, not even on the day of my next shot. Felt fine. 

I'm on my second week of my second shot and no withdrawal symtoms at all, although I must say, I have many more cravings now they I'm not ""taking"" anything. so there's that.

There's also the matter of the lump at the injection site.  I also workout more than regularly, it's a true hobby of mine, and this lump ain't cool at all, and that's coming from a married dude. I couldn't imagine being single with this thing. Having said that the second lump is much much smaller than the first as i pulled the fat up while she injected it in the center of my pulled fat. This reduced the size by about 50%. Also, beginning with the 3rd injection, the volume of the dose reduces by 66%, so assume your lump will at least be 50-66% smaller.

22,nf323j,"Anyone here have any experience(s) taking Psilocybin (Magic Mushrooms) while on Subs?. I apologize for the random question. I'm still very new to subs, and have only been taking them since last Thurs / Fri to help get off of a VERY heavy 6 year Tianeptine habit. As soon as the subs started working I was just overwhelmed with emotion because it was such a relief. I had tried to get off Tia a thousand times using a thousand different drugs and methods, obviously to no avail. I'm actually somewhat worried by how good I feel 5 days in. Normally, on day 5 of WD'ing from Tia I would've been awake for 5 days straight and was just a shell of a person. 

Anyway, to my point. Well, I've had a dozen or so experiences with Psilocybin in the past while growing up, and every experience had a profoundly positive impact on my life. Even the 'bad trips' I'd have. In fact, the 'bad trips', although quite traumatic in the moment, were the ones that yielded the most 'knowledge' so to speak, through means of self reflection and viewing / interpreting things through a different lens / perspective.
I haven't been able to have any insightful experiences like this for over half a decade now. Tianeptine is an SSRE (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Enhancer), and since the molecular compound of Psilocybin is so similar to Serotonin, magic mushrooms had almost no effect whatsoever.

So here's my issue. I'm only 5 days into taking subs and there's a real possibility that this is all just in my head since I'm finally feeling better. But the way the subs have me feeling over these 5 days makes me think they might have a pretty intense impact on Serotonin, Norepinephrine, or Dopamine, in the same way that anti depressants might. I'm hoping that's not the case, because if it is then it's probably going to greatly diminish the effects as well.

Have any of you out there tried or taken psilocybin mushrooms while actively taking subs? What was your experience like, was it comparable to prior experiences when you weren't taking subs? 

A quick Google search of 'Suboxone and Seretonin' just brings up articles talking about people getting serotonin syndrome from Suboxone and what not, so it was no help. So I'll ask my fellow brothers and sisters out there of their personal experiences. Any information or experiences you guys would be kind enough to share, would be greatly, greatly appreciated.

So well that on Day 15, the first day without, that evening was a complete disaster! As a male it's hard to admit this, but I was a fucking mess. My moods after my Vyvanse wore off took a dive into the ditch. I was probably crying pretty hard on and off for an hour about how terrible my life is. Like I was so down it was almost suicidal territory. I was then so angry I couldn't do anything to escape my head like I had done for the past 14 days with those meds, that I was literally punching walls. I don't know how but even after being told on here by others, I didn't expect how I would react to having so many downers in my system to suddenly none. It was like how bad things would get when I was in active addiction and was sick and wanted so badly to just use opiates. I felt the same sort of desperation for the meds I had just stopped. I don't regret using them for 2 weeks but I think maybe a fast 1 week additional taper off them may have helped. Yesterday night started to turn but I talked myself out of it and just stirred in bed most the evening. The first two nights without the meds have given me very little sleep. I guess I should have expected that too but since I was actually sleeping better for the 2 weeks then I was on Suboxone, I easily forgot what withdrawal really is lol. I also stopped the Lopermaid on Day 14 as well so to say things have been ""running"" is an understatement. Also, the body aches picked up without the meds but Advil is still taking most them away. So besides the sleep and digestive issues which are hallmarks of this process I guess things could be much worse. Like we all know, this now seems like it's mostly a mental game. I've been struggling with depression before going off Suboxone so I won't be surprised now if it continues while my brain heals and/or medication for that gets adjusted. Right now I feel worse then when I was on Suboxone, but I know the only thing needed right now is time. Lots of fucking time. I'll be honest as well, the last two nights if the opportunity to use was presented in would have taken it. So for anyone reading this, just be careful getting off Suboxone.

Seven hours later at 9pm I dosed 4mg of subutex.
am I going to be ok??

from what I’ve researched on past BL posts regarding mixing Klonopin and subs (or just benzos and subs in general)
that it’s dangerous and deadly if you DONT have a tolerance to both.
However, if you have a tolerance to one or the other, then it’s safe provided you don’t go to crazy with your dosing. 
That’s from what I’ve read before.

Yesterday, we restarted my subs, and I'm having kind of a hard time. Been having *crazy* nausea and just don't feel good in general. Hoping to get some input here...

For reference, prior to surgery I was on a dose of 6mg once  daily. In the perioperative period, we used a multimodal pain plan consisting of continuous low-dose ketamine (10mg/h), 15mg oral oxycodone every three hours as needed, and very rarely .5mg IV hydromorphone for breakthrough pain. My pain was well-managed for the most part. 

Yesterday, I endured several hours without pain meds in order to successfully get back on my dose. I was offered 2mg at one and 4mg at five, but I only took 2mg each time, as I wasn't feeling super well and realized I'd want to take a full dose as scheduled this morning. Through the night I had terrible nausea, which subsided for a while in the wee hours but is currently quite awful.

Anyway, it seems the suboxone is causing the nausea, but I'm not sure why. Does my dose need an adjustment after this week? Anyone that's been in a similar situation, I'd be so grateful for your experience. Thanks for reading everyone.","['PPE', 'MA']",0,1,1,0,0,0

77,nw7lc0,"Doctor Wants me on Subs: Benzo and Kratom Addict. I'll try to keep this short and sweet because my ADHD usually has me leaving long-winded posts. Soooo, my partner and I are both addicted and dependent on Etizolam and Kratom. We have tried pretty much every RC benzo in the past in the ""honeymoon days"" and we used to abuse Percocet, till I found Kratom. I lost my source for Perc and it was too expensive online, so I fell in love with Kratom. I have tapered off completely before, but probably the longest break was 6-7 days (without benzos). In October '19, I wanted to get off Kratom, used Clonazolam, abused it and didn't stop after I was through the woods of Kratom WD. I had jumped at 8GPD from a 30GPD habit.

Fast forward to now, I am a shell of my former self. I stay up late, I sleep in as long as I can. I'm afraid of everything, can barely leave my house without Kratom + Etizolam dose. I'm malnourished. I don't drink much water. I'm living like an invalid junkie. I was going to full-time school for a specific job, but I had to withdrawal (I can go back when I'm ready--I paid upfront) because it was like 24 credit hours. Also classes were all gonna be in-person, starting at 8:45am, and I've never been a morning person. With my bad memory, anxiety, having to manage addictions secretly while in 8-hr days of class, and not being able to work because the material IS DIFFICULT. Lots of science and learning it way too fast. I was having panic attacks, so I withdrew. I felt better for the first few days...so much stress off my shoulder.

But now I find myself at home, wasting away, maybe able to accomplish 4 tasks per day. I'm so demotivated. I feel worthless and hopeless.

OKAY: so here's my dilemma. Everything I've read about using Suboxone to quit Kratom is that it's outrageous. I've asked several friends who know the drug world and they all say it's a bad idea. And I mostly agree. The doctor wrote me one week of Clonazepam, 1mg, 2x daily. He was gonna give me Xanax but I said I hate intradose withdrawals. And of course he referred me to the MAT program two floors below him. I think they hate Kratom because the docs, FDA, and Big Pharma are losing patients to a natural plant. My partner goes to same doctor and he started Suboxone about 3 weeks ago. He quit Kratom like after 2 days and has no cravings (DUH). But what astounded me the most is he was able to lower his Etizolam from 20mg to 4mg immediately. He started having some tremors at night, and I recognized he was going through benzo WDs from the rapid dosage cut, but the doctors didn't agree. He took a little more Etizolam for a few days and he seems better.

SO this is a long-ass post. I'm sorry. My question is...should I try Suboxone? It has changed him for the better. He doesn't need to dose benzos every 4 hours and he isn't having to time out Kratom and food, or worrying about which strain to take, etc. I'm jealous of that. He smiles now and laughs. He has more energy. He is like a brand-new person. Meanwhile I'm still taking 20G of Kratom a day and at least 18-20mg of Etizolam. Day 2 of Klonopin so I know I will likely be able to lower Etiz as well. My partner had a good argument. He said ""everything you've been doing since you started taking Percocet hasn't worked. things just have gotten worse. Maybe it's time to listen to medical professionals.""

I am SOOOO divided on this. I have an appt next week and have already expressed concerns about moving from Kratom to an actual, super-potent opioid, usually indicated for those with opioid use disorder. But maybe I'm in denial. If someone offered me a pain pill, I would take it in a heartbeat. I also made the mistake of ordering 200 Nucynta from India one night when I was really high on Etizolam and Flubromazolam. Haven't had any of that since January or February. I remember being dope sick in class and it was pretty bad for a few days. It's been over a month since I ordered and not sure it's even shipped... maybe it won't come. I'll be mad, especially because it contained a bunch of Cialis and Viagra (which I DO need). But shit, what if it does come and I have 200 100mg Nucynta pills. For reference, one pill is equal to 20mg of Oxycodone. I don't think I have the willpower to throw them away. And I don't really have any friends in my current city I can sell them to. I could visit back home and probably sell all of them and make a lot more than I paid. 

Thoughts and opinions, please?

TL;DR? Polysubstance addict/abuser who just got prescribed Klonopin to come off Etizolam and is getting referred to the Suboxone maintenance program to kick Kratom. This feels like a lifechanging decision. I'm just not sure if it'll be for the good or the bad... Should I work with the docs and give Suboxone a try, seeing as it's helping my partner so much and I'm sick of how I'm living currently?

81,i4m2ea,"New to sub have a couple questions. Hi! I've been lurking on this subreddit and several others for a while and now I'm finally stepping up to talk. I feel....nervous?

I've been taking 120-180mg oxy for about 7 months. On oxy illicitly for about 2.5 years at lower doses. It's amazing that it's taken this long but I am finally at a point where I simply cannot afford this anymore. 

I quit last year for 6 weeks using Kratom and ativan. (Don't congratulate me I only did it because my plug lost his supply.) It was abjectly miserable. I honestly didn't feel mentally even a little bit better after 6 weeks. I was internally debating if I wanted to live like that.  I found out my plug got a new supplier and went back to it. 

A couple of times in the last year I've stopped for a few days at a time using subs, so I have a little bit of an idea what dose to use, or at least I thought I did. 

Although I'm somewhat undecided, I think I want to try subs for a relatively short time then taper off. I think that is risky for me but I also don't want to stay on them forever.  After reading a lot on here I'm sure y'all would agree!

I started a couple days ago taking 4mg at 6am when I wake up to take another med (I have several weird health conditions and am on a lot of medications just not pain meds.) Day 1&2 I felt pretty good until midafternoon, a little bit of chills/sweating but completely tolerable. By midafternoon I was feeling crappy but it sorta seems like most people dose twice a day so I waited until 7pm to take another 4mg and then I felt better. (The last times I tried subs I found 1-2 mgs wasn't enough for me but 4mg did the trick.)  


Today, Day 3, I took the 4mg at 6am. I was VERY groggy and had a hard time getting up. I continued feeling crappy and actually got back into bed. Finally at 2pm I took 2mg. That helped pretty dramatically until 4:30. Suddenly I got VERY fatigued and nauseous. I made it through grocery shopping but had to lie down when I got home. I hadn't eaten much because I've not had much appetite today. So I'm sure that was a factor. But I don't think it was the only factor.   


My regular oxy WDs manifest mainly as severe lack of motivation and fatigue, major irritability, lack of appetite, as well as of course runny nose and hot/cold sweats.

Finally at 7pm I took another 4mg and now I'm feeling better. 

My 2 questions are:  
Do you think I need to dose 3 times a day? Is that common?

83,oqj9n2,"Cold turkey. Just looking for some insight or experience with a certain situation im in.

Some background, started using opioids around 6 years ago, started off with tramadol, worked my up to oxys (200-300 mg/day). Managed to get off that but only lasted a few weeks before I found myself right back at it. This time with Methadone tho (not prescribed), at my worst I was taking upto 300mgs daily...managed to wean to a low-ish dose (60 maybe) then jumped. Again, lasted a few weeks till I was back. The one thing I did differently this time was start Suboxone as soon as I could, ive had a few episodes of PWD from dosing too soon but this time things went smoothly.

Now I've been on subs for about a year now. I dont really have a fixed dose; I take anywhere from 1.5 to 14mgs daily, but my aver would sit at say 5mg daily.

6 days ago I tried something new (new for me at least). I took around 24mgs as a single dose...my reasoning was that since Bupe has such a long half life it would bring me down slowly enough for my body to adjust untill there was nothing left in my system.

What I dont get is that so far haven't had any withdrawals...maybe a chill here and there, little bit of anxiety occasionally. I know bupe withdrawal takes longer to kick in, but after 6 days shouldnt I be feeling much worse? I dont know if the high loading dose actually worked, or of it just delayed what's coming.

88,tpeiiu,"Previous subs user. Got better. Relapsed. Now I get COVID on my first days of using subs again. Help.. Hi all. I’ll try to keep this short. 

Was a 10+ year oxy/fent user since basically high school through law school and beyond (somehow managed to pass the Bar while in major WDs…will never understand that). 

Oxy (and that fake oxy fent from the street) cost me my job. Moved abroad to Europe where after getting a little better, I got sick again. When docs don’t know what OxyNorm is and prescribe it naively at 5-10 bucks per package, hard to say no. 

Quit agaiiiin. This time with suboxone. And it worked! Two years clean!

Until this past April 2021. OTC codeine. 5 bucks a box. 

Been taking 1800-2400mg per day. Every day. Since April 2021. 

I’m now on day 6 without codeine. 

The problem is two fold:

1. Day 1 of detox is day 1 of COVID. How’s that for luck? Triple vaccinated and my kid brings it home from school. This sucks not because of COVID (sorry but not my priority right now!)…it sucks because it’s so hard to distinguish between COVID symptoms and WD symptoms. (I am triple vaxxed and my symptoms lean more towards WD symptoms and not COVID like symptoms, but I’m no doctor). 

2. I’m basically “stabilized” at 1mg of Buprex per day (no naloxone). Sometimes I take 1.2mg. Sometimes point 8.  

I know less is more. But the problem is … and I can’t tell if this is just my junkie mentality or COVID …. But I just don’t feel better. The only thing stopping me from getting out of bed for codeine is the fact I know the bupe is blocking any potential high. My RLS is still all day every day. I’m still in full body pain. I still have anxiety. And my sleep is shit. Dehydrated, lazy, can’t move, etc. 

I’m rambling but I guess I’m asking … should I just be miserable on 1mg and wait and see? Should I give 2mg a shot one day to see if my symptoms go away? How bad will it mess up my tolerance or potential taper if one day I take an extra mg of subs?

I really just wanna know if I need more subs to feel better, and if I do, will it kill me to try 2mg one day and go back to 1mg the next (meaning, if I find out 2 isn’t any better help). 

Thanks for any help. I really just don’t think my issues are COVID related given how fucking vaxxed I am + my wife and kids who also have COVID at the same time feel great. 

FWIW, people who trash talk codeine as being weak … I get it. I really do. Just know hell is relative and opiates are opiates. I’ve done the oxys and fent laced presses and the fent patches and sniffed H. I see how some look down on codeine. But it’s hard man. It’s hard. To each their own.

104,oovpqu,"Horrible cold sweats 😰. Hi folks, I’ve been lurking on this fabulous group for the past couple of months now in anticipation of getting back on suboxone.
I originally became stable on 8mg after having a hefty oxy habit and remained on that for three years with very few issues. 
Anyhow, I tapered myself off and stupidly thought I could dabble in H again. Stupid mistake. I actually hadn’t used in nearly 20 years and I got sucked back in hard. After trying to get myself back on subs several times and ending up in ER with shocking PW I finally bit the bullet and went to an out patient clinic. 
The good news is that I didn’t get any PW and day one I took 12mg. Felt pretty rough but got through it. Day 2 they upped me to 24 because my COWS score was much higher even though I felt a tad better than the previous day. Today is day (night three) I had 28 today and do feel considerably better. Definitely not good, but not in pain and my stomach has mostly settled. 
The thing that’s killing me though is the sweating. I never had this previously on suboxone so I’m hoping it’s just still my body still experiencing withdrawal symptoms. My eyes are still like saucers too. It’s just thrown me as my other symptoms seem fairly well covered.
I know it’s still extremely early days but do you think this is a normal part of stabilisation? 
I’m managing to get an hour of sleep at a time before waking up in a pool of cold sweat and having to strip my bed. It’s currently 4am and have just put my third set of sheets on for the night 😢 If it was the heat of summer I’d be able to hack it but it’s cold here-  degrees Celsius (about 35f I think) and I’m finding it extremely hard. I never sweat this much even going cold turkey. 
Even during the day it’s non stop. Even though I felt a bit better today these cold sweats are really freaking me out. I’m not normally a sweater so I’m hoping it’s just all an early part of the process.
I hate the idea of being on such a high dose but I’m willing to do whatever I can to get stable and tackle the taper to a lower level after.
I just feel really confused an my non religious self is praying this is just part of the process.

120,eao6cy,"Managing Precipitated Withdrawals. Long story short, this is the second time I’ve had to deal with this hell, and God willing the last time.  Around the early 2000s I got off oxy by using subs and I never experienced PWs at all.  Clean for years and years until around 2018 and I got back into the dope game.  I caught myself fairly quickly last time, got a prescription for subs, waited 12 hours to induce and was immediately launched into the the worst hell I’ve ever experienced.  I’ve been through a couple combat tours in Iraq as an Infantryman and I’d take that over PWs any day.  Somehow, I managed to make it through and stabilized on subs, then weaned off those and was good to go until about a month ago when I slipped again like a dumbass.  I went back to the doc, got my sub script again, and this time waited 24 hours to be safe.  Well, fuck me if it didn’t throw me into PWs again.  I wasn’t able to make it through these though, went and copped and feel a little better 12 hours later, thank God.  My question is when should I begin taking subs again?  I have taken around 8mg over the last 12 hours (2mg at a time) and no relief could be found until I copped today.  Granted, I’m not high because the bupe has a higher affinity, but I do feel as if it has helped.  My goal is to get this shit behind me and get my sub regimen started but I’m scared to take more subs, even though now that the bupe has bound to my receptors, I should be able to continue taking small doses until I stabilize, even though I have supplemented with dope to soothe the hellish PWs, right?   I mean, with bupe in your system, even if you use, it can’t replace the bupe and so I shouldn’t start the PW train over if I does the subs still.  At least that’s what my research has led me to believe.  Anyone know from experience?

To start the new chapter of my sobriety.  I do not drink or partake in any mind altering substances to maintain my sobriety other then my bup. Meds. I am a 27 year old mom. And I've had a hard time finding an outlet to share and converse with others. I live in a rural small town, plagued with the ""all addicts are the devil"" mentality. Coupled with "" Its not my fault, I can't change cus its beyond my control"" crutch. And I just need a place where I can talk with ppl that understand my fight, and where I'm coming from. See I believe we all started our addiction one way or another, whether from medical issues, partying lifestyle that went out of control, or self medicating our mental or physical pains. This is what I label the beginning. Sometimes we are not in control of our beginnings, but what we are in control with is the middle, and our end. And I refuse to believe we have no control over the middles and ends, and don't accept excuses, or blaming others for the outcomes of such. I believe we only get better when we take ownership of our relapses, falls, and failures, rather then blame others for them. We all make choices, regardless of outside influence. And even when we lose control to an outside force, we are held accountable to regain control. Like many, inpatience rehab would prove useless to me. I needed to recover while continuing life day by day to retrain my brain, and lifestyle. I chose to take the medication assistance and have on track almost 6 years now, and for the past year, I have been wheening from medication. I have faced hate, and battled the stigma. Mistreated by others, doctors, and pharmacies. Treated like a monster most times. I discovered I was pregnant alittle over 2 years ago and worked closely with 3 specialists to keep this unexpected but automatically wanted baby healthy and safe. Yet faced stigmas and unbelievable obstacles by the Healthcare workers. And I feel often isolated.

150,rnbdp1,"Need help. Trying to find the right dose that works for me and what I’m looking for. TL:DR: I have tried suboxone in the past and I know what I am looking for from it. Unfortunately I am having trouble finding the correct dose for my needs. (No I’m not trying to get high! Just trying to knock cravings) any suggestions?
 Full story below, I would appreciate if you read it if you have the time!

So my story is essentially I’m looking for a way to get away from kratom with the help of a doctor so I am no longer self medicating. I am looking for similar benefits to what kratom provided me with. Motivation, general sense of well-being, and inner peace. Normally I would be way more pro kratom then suboxone, but I happened to have a weird reaction the last time I took kratom and I ended up having a seizure that almost ended my life. For that reason alone I will never touch that plant again, I had no idea that could happen from taking kratom. 

When I’ve tried suboxone in the past with no / low opioid tolerance it was exactly like I expected. A low euphoria less recreational opiod feeling that was very long lasting and effective but not something you could abuse without having nasty side effects. 

Unfortunately I just got my first prescription for suboxone the other day and so far I have not been able to get the desired benifts from it I’m looking for. I started with 2 mg and it was absolutely nothing (still in pain level of nothing) so I took 3 then 2 hours later another mg for a total of 4 mg assuming that that would be more than enough, but still seems very weak, not getting those benefits I did the first time I tried suboxone. So today I started with 4 then took another 2mg and still wasn’t even close to what I was expecting/ looking for :(

I’m worried I’m going to go back to craving kratom if this is the extent of my suboxone experience. I’m not sure how I don’t notice anything from 6 mg when I was just using kratom and had been tapering off for multiple days before I started the subs. 

What dose do you think I should try? I’m probably gonna start with 7 or 8 tomorrow even tho I never thought I’d need to go that high. Do you think I should take 2mg for a couple of days then go back to 4-6 and see if it’s more effective?","['CDU', 'PPE', 'MA']",0,1,1,1,0,0

I have forced myself to stay busy recently bought a home after many years of saving and depression has hit. Day 1-3 were the most intense body aches and fever of my life. Day 4-7 were stuck in bed tossing and turning and in the bathroom puking my guts out. Day 8 today I finally feel a little better I mowed half my yard gave my dog a bath and did other odds and ins around the house. I am trying so hard to stay positive but my mood swings are hell on my kids and wife but they understand, but it’s no excuse. I dabbled in non opiates my first 2-3 years into Suboxone but haven’t touched anything pill or street wise since. I started to drink too much but that comes next one thing at a time. It’s been extremely hard to type this as to my anxiety which is horrific right now. I just needed to say I’m starting to see the light and any feedback at all would be appreciated. I’m a 31 year old male military veteran so Iv had my share of hard times but this is a mind game at this point oh and if anyone is going to detox soon body armor and vitamins make sure you eat something daily or your lack of energy on top of lack of energy will be beyond surprising.

152,8btzft,"A cautionary tale against kratom and why it's worse than being on Suboxone. Let me preface this by saying that I used suboxone from 2006-2009 after a several year long addiction to oxycontin. I was clean for almost 7 years, then got hit by a car while crossing the street. I was back on prescription opiates for a few weeks, but not wanting to go back down that path again, I looked into pain relieving alternatives. That's when I found r/kratom. I then took kratom twice daily for almost two years and quickly became physically addicted to it.    

&nbsp;

My experience getting off of suboxone was quite honestly a cake walk. Once I got to 2mg, I spent almost a year tapering down to zero and once I jumped completely, I felt 100% normal. As such, after dozens of failed attempts to taper down on kratom, I found myself back here considering using suboxone to treat my kratom addiction.  


&nbsp;
 
That's when I started seeing an alarming trend: People that are at the end of their suboxone taper being recommended kratom. People that have been in treatment for a short time being told kratom is the better choice. People expressing interest in suboxone being told that they've got it all wrong, just get some kratom and you'll be happier for it. I personally got downvoted and all but called an absolute idiot for considering suboxone instead of kratom. I want to tell you guys why I think these recommendations are not only foolish, but downright counter-intuitive in relation to an addict that's trying to free themselves from their previous lifestyle.  
 
&nbsp;

First, let's talk about the common side effects of kratom vs Suboxone:  

&nbsp;

**Suboxone:**  
* Constipation  
* Diziness (at high doses)  
* Fatigue (at high doses)  
* Nausea (at high doses)  
* Physical withdrawal with missed doses  
* Urinary tract infections (in women)  

&nbsp;

**Kratom:**  
*(Please feel free to search any of these terms in r/quittingkratom to see how common they truly are)*   
* Constipation  
* Hairloss    
* Fatigue   
* Physical withdrawal with missed doses (this typically starts between 5-8 hours after last dose once you're physically dependent)  
* Difficulty urinating      
* Incontinence  
* Nausea  
* Dizziness    
* Vomiting   
* ""The wobbles"" also known as pressure behind the eyes and inability to focus your eyes)  
* Lowered testosterone  
* Adrenal fatigue  
* Difficulty sleeping 

&nbsp;

I will add that out of all of the side effects I have listed under kratom, I have experienced every single one (except lowered testosterone, I am a woman) personally almost every single day since I started. The worst ones are difficulty urinating (I can feel like my bladder is about to explode but be completely unable to pee for hours), hairloss (I lose clumps in the shower every single day and my eyebrows are falling out), and withdrawal between doses. I wake up every single morning with waterfalls of snot coming out of my nose, chills, achey joints, tears streaming down my face, and shortness of breath. That's just from sleeping through the night.  

&nbsp;
   
But the biggest reason I think kratom is a terrible choice for the people in this sub is that it gets you high. Why haven't I quit despite all of the side effects listed above? Because I am an addict, and even after almost two years of being on kratom, I still get high twice a day, every single day. Suboxone can get you high for the first few days that you take it, but as long as you're using it correctly, it just keeps you stable and craving free. Don't throw your treatment down the toilet by trading suboxone for something that gets you high.

&nbsp;

I hope that everyone will do their own research on what I have explained here. The reason you don't hear a lot of negative stuff about kratom is because r/kratom censors any negative comments or posts about the stuff because they're afraid it's going to be classified a schedule 1 substance. Some of them are also in the honeymoon phase of kratom abuse, where you've convinced yourself that you won't be like everyone else and you're experiencing few side effects. That will last a month, maybe two if you're lucky.  

&nbsp;

So please be careful and speak up when people are recommending addictive substances to people that are just trying to get their lives back on track. Coming off of suboxone doesn't have to be hard as long as you're smart with your taper and don't try to jump off at too high of a dose or taper down too fast. I am more than happy to talk about how I was able to come off of suboxone painlessly, just let me know if that's something you would like to read about. This post is already long enough.  

&nbsp;

**Edit:** A few of the responses claim that they still get ""high"" after months/ years of taking Suboxone. Not trying to be a dick here, but that isn't possible if you're taking the medication as prescribed. First of all, bupeprenorphine is only a partial agonist and has a high affinity but little intrinsic activity at the mu opioid receptors in the first place. Even with full agonist opioids, you would have to continually increase your dose to maintain the same effect on receptors over time. Kratom, on the other hand, has alkaloids that act as full agonists, similar to harder opiates like oxycodone, heroin, etc. Opiates will only continue getting you high over time if you increase the dose as your existing receptors become desensitized with repeated use.","['CDU', 'PPE']",0,0,1,1,0,0
153,wjls4s,"I’m very strongly considering transitioning from suboxone to sublocade in order to taper off. I have some questions any help is appreciated 😁. I have been on suboxone for years and I feel like I’m ready to come off of it. I am really excited but have a few questions. I take 6mg generic strips I believe I would probably do 300-100-100 and maybe one more 100.

1. Is it generally covered by Medicaid? Im in Pennsylvania. If so is it 100% covered?

2. How bad is the pain of the injection (during and after) and does it leave a noticeable lump on someone with low body fat? Does the injection on the stomach cause pain when working out your core?

3. Is it really true that you can taper off with no withdrawal at all because of how long the drug lingers?

4. Was there any withdrawal or difficulty transitioning from sublingual bupe to sublocade?

You need not answer all of my questions, any insight is greatly appreciated. This seems like a miracle for me as I have been unable to taper any lower than 6 mgs with suboxone.","['PPE', 'AL', 'TP']",1,0,1,0,1,0

I'm currently on 16mg of subutex a day, 4mg of klonopin and also 2mg of lunesta at night. I've been on these meds for 3 years and despite the meds I've not used any other drugs. So yay for sobriety. I will be getting a 300mg sublucade injection tomorrow at 1030. I'm a skinny guy and I have birdshot that covers my stomach. I was shot by my ""best friend"" for no reason. So I was wondering a few things. One being skinny and also the birdshot will this make the shot hurt ? What are yalls experiences with sublucade. I also was given 30 days of my normal subutex and 30 days of 2mg subutex just to help me with getting medicad in texas and also finding a doctor. (I know this is a pain from personal experience). Anyway I'm getting off topic. My doctor said by the time the dose of sublucade wears off I will be able to use 6 to 8mg instead of my normal 16... Giving me even longer to situate things in texas. Is this true ? Also what is this going to feel like compared to me taking 16mg in the morning sublingual? Sorry for so many questions. I'm nervous about the move and also just the shot in general. So any experiences and help or and advice is helpful. Sorry if this post was all over the place. Thanks y'all ! Also I apologise for any grammer issues I'm just waking up. Thanks for anyone who responds.

Edit: also I leave Sunday so if I have any complications I'm gonna be without insurance. I don't expect too but I feel like this is the best decision so I can find a doctor in texas without worrying about running out of meds.","['PPE', 'MA', 'AL']",1,1,1,0,0,0

158,iq5pnr,"Can we ger agreed? SL vs Nasal. 2mg nasal is something between 3 or 4mg sublingual.
If I'm taking 4mg nasal through the day and tommorow switch to SL route - should I feel slight WD or I will be good?

Bioavailability SL is 30% of medicine.
Nasal is 48 to 50% (mixed with couple drops of vodka and you are about 70% sublingual). 

So, it u r taking 4mg SL, your body is getting 1.333mg in bloodstream.
If you take it nasal, your body is getting 2mg in bloodstream. 

If you take little vodka and disolve tablet in spoon till whole tablet mix with it - take a peace and of cotton and let it soak. 
Then you just put it under tongue and let it sit there for 15 mins. 
You're getting 70% bioavailability. 

So, this way if you take 4mg, you're getting ~3mg into bloodstream. 

And now we come to this:

Sublingual is keeping you steady for whole day. 

Taking up a in the nose - you can get through the day but you will feel as evening is coming that effects wore off... 

And if you take with couple drops of vodka and cotton - you're high like you take it nasal and it has longer effect than classic sublingual route.

163,uesfwg,"How do I withdrawal off fent replacing with a diff full agonist??. FULL details are below but I copped and then once more until my tooth pain went away. 
I tried to take my subs 14 hours later and put myself in a precipitated withdrawal so I went and got more to make it go away. It’s been about 3 weeks to 3.5 weeks of use daily. 

Now I’m so scared to even try my subs that I keep getting more just to avoid withdrawal at all costs. 
I have two kids, my dog, and I live with family. If i ever ran a day short on my meds someone would notice, so withdrawal off this fent shiz is not something I can cover up. Nor do I want to.  

I’ve seen the info about the Bernese method, but I’ve also seen that if you replace the fent with a different fill agonist like prescription oxycodone, morphine, etc that you can then induct onto your suboxone without having to fear the precipitated withdrawal ??? 

How does that work??? Do I have to take them for a certain time or can I just take them for a couple days then wait 24 hours and get back on my Suboxone?? 

I’ve been using now for about a month, literally only 2 days max in between uses. But I CAN NOT keep doing this. I was doing great and now I’m taking any money I have just to not experience any withdrawal I can. Being clean for almost 4 years, I can’t throw that all away. 

So yeah, how do I use the dalaudid or however u spell it that I got to get back on my subs without causing precipitated withdrawal??? 





SPECIFICS : 


Just recently I had the worst toothache of my life ( basically dentist wasn’t available, 2 ER visits did nothing) and I hadn’t slept in days. 
I couldn’t even take my suboxone because it was causing pain to my bottom lower teeth as well. I was on them for close to 4 years. 

I was going to get Percs to just help with the pain and like a stupidAs* I contacted my old dealer. Souly for the purpose of pain relief. 

I copped and then once more until the pain went away. 
I tried to take my subs 14 hours later and put myself in a precipitated withdrawal so I went and got more to make it go away. 
I did not realize how much this new fent lingers!! If I knew how long it would take for my subs to be safe to work again, I never would have used again. 

I thought I could get some pain relief and then just go back to life as normal as I’ve done in the past.

So I have been using suboxone for the past 4 years except for many relapses on heroin\fentanyl. The suboxone seemed to enable my problematic IV opiate use. Got stuck in a cycle of 3 months on subs, save money, then blast through it on dope in 1-2 weeks. Then suffer 2-3 days, get back on subs, and repeat. I got arrested 2\7 after a 4 day relapse for nodding off at a stop light. I was taking 8mg\day before the 4 day relapse. Was forced to detox in jail. Fuuuuuuuuck it sucked. 23hr lockdown too... But anyways, I made bail after 13 days and am feeling incredible. My testosterone has sky rocketed, my thoughts are so clear, and my confidence is drastically higher. Because it feels so good, I am now committed to never ever touching any opiate again, no matter what.

I have only slept 8 hrs since 2/7. This is the only symptom that is still bothering me. I still get goosebumps, sneeze 30-50x a day, and have mild diarrhea, but I can handle all that just fine.

Any experience for expectations on when I will be able to sleep? I just checked into a rehab with the hopes that I can get my pending felonies reduced, so marijuana is unfortunately not an option rn.

170,foek6r,"I want to share this post suboxone story with yall.. So, while I have a few minutes, I wanted to take a minute to tell yall a little story to hopefully encourage yall!

7 years ago, around this time, I was a freshly medically retired Staff Sergeant in the Army. I was 29 at the time. The reason for this is because I cracked my L1 vertebrae in a airborne jump, then had a L5-S1 spinal fusion one year later. That started a very rough 6 years for me.

I was put on everything from Tylenol-3, Percocet, Oxycodone, Oxycontin, and Buprenorphine, just to name a few for pain management. It went from a necessity, to a dependence, to a full blown addiction. When pain pill restrictions got tighter, and I stopped getting my meds, I switched to Suboxone. It is a prescription that is supposed curb addiction and keep you from going into opiate withdrawal. This was from 2016 to 2019. Getting Suboxone was more stressful then it was worth, and more expensive to boot. I could have gone through the VA..but...no.

May 2019..I was out of shape, weighed 220 lbs, and was just not happy.

And then something happened. Call it, a wake-up call. My doctors office got shut down and I had 15 of my strips left. A safe taper takes months...MONTHS. I did it in 1 month. 

The withdrawals were horrible for that month. However, I bought a bike, starting going to the gym, and started working on bettering me. My first ride was in June of last year. A tiny 14 miler in 1 hour, 35 minutes. And it continued from there. I went from 220 to 200lbs in about 2 months. Until...the kidney stones....

All my progress was thwarted. All the extra activity sent my kidney stones into go mode. I ended up in the ER twice with bilateral kidney stones. I required two surgeries and was back on Percocet. When they were gone, I searched my house for Suboxone and found about 10. When I went through them and started to heal, I went through mild withdrawals again, I was back up to 220 and always..just..bleh.

Then the strangest thing happened. I won $3,500 at WInstar. I bought a new phone, headphones and bike. I biked until winter, then hit the gym for more biking. I was doing 30 miles in 70 minutes on the stationary. When the gyms starting closing, I braved the elements and hit the trail again. I am up to 48 miles in a little over 3 hours and am getting better with every ride. I am down to 190 lbs now and feel like I have life back!

I know its hard and its sucks. But I promise you, the storm will pass and you will feel better eventually. I had to work a full 50 hour week the day after I jumped from the tiniest, tiniest piece of Sub. It was brutal. I am so proud of where I am now though that I'd never even consider jumping back. I am now opiate free, fit, healthy, and loving life. Next is to start a new career. Babysteps.

The slight mood lift and energy I once got from subs have been gone this whole time. I'm having trouble just getting simple stuff around the house done. As soon as I make dinner or start to clean, I'm immediately dying to sit back down. I was wondering if anyone had experience with modafinil or armofinil.. did it help with motivation? Was it a synergistic pairing? 

I would love to just quit, but I am not ready for that yet. The last time I was out there, heroin couldnt be found. Everything was fent. I dont want to put myself into a situation of becoming so desperate to where im not thinking or seeing things clearly and end up dead. I want to have the confidence in being able to stay clean. Subs is a double edged sword for me.  I'd probably be dead without subs,  yet subs is still keeping me from moving forward and finding a more meaningful life. The lack of motivation for anything other than running out for candy has put a real hold on my life. I know more drugs might sound like a bad idea to some of you, but for me, it might be the only safe way out.

Update 4-27-2020 I'm still having motivation issues with subs. Quarantine doesn't help. Today was my first time trying  modafinil, except the one I tried is called 'modvigil.'

179,s71w2l,"Facing the end of my script. No new one in sight.. I sold my house and moved across the country.  I had WA state health insurance after losing my job about 5 months into the pandemic.  Before I moved, I was able to get my WA state Dr to write 2 more months worth of scripts, to get me started in SC.  I'm cleaning houses, and my husband just started his second job here, so we are 90 days away from getting any health insurance.  We make too much for state health insurance, but really cannot afford these online prescriber either.  

I tried Recovery Delivered - Spruce, but it was going to cost almost $700/mo.  I was a new patient, so I had to pay for weekly appointments ($75) and then my weekly out of pocket weekly meds ($90) plus buying your own drug test weekly.  Beyond the extreme cost, the pharmacist I talked to said that no SC pharmacy will fill an online prescription.  It's against SC law.  So even if I had the $700/month (I don't) I can't use online prescribers in SC.  In WA I had done phone visits for the last 2 years, so I didn't worry about taking a drug test either.  I know you have to have a clean test to get a script.  The 4th issue is that I got 3 other prescriptions from my sub Dr. in WA and going to an online Suboxone prescriber isn't going to help with those other scripts.

How does anyone fill gaps in their health coverage?  To be put on my husband's insurance is going to be insanely expensive, but we can't even do that for another 90 days.

XPOST:
Im working on revamping our suboxone faq in sidebar, but in the meantime I was inspired by a great informative post earlier on suboxone and wanted to write up another post with more information since these questions are constantly asked here and there is constant misinformation being spread. After a bit more editing, this will be added to the sidebar and available for reference :)

Bupe/sub defined; its forms & doses; its purposes
-What is suboxone? Suboxone is a brand name drug manufactured by Reckitt-Benckiser that is a combination of buprnorphine and naloxone in a 4:1 ratio. It is a moderately powerful semi-synthetic opioid that is most commonly used as a maintenance medication for people that are opioid dependent; however it can also be used for a couple other purposes that will be covered in this guide. It is the preferred medication for maintenance treatment because it is only a partial agonist and doesn't have all the awesome euphoria associated with most opioids. It also has a ceiling effect that keeps people from just upping the dose through the rough and getting high like with methadone.

-What forms and doses does it typically come in?

Suboxone strips(or generic strips): buprenorphine / naloxone 4:1.

Subutex: buprenorphine

Generic tablets: buprenorphine/ naloxone 4:1

DOSES AVAILABLE: 2mg, 4mg, 8mg, 12mg

*there also is Zubsolv, which is another bupe/nalox combo but with an additive for better absorption resulting in higher bioavailability.

-What is it prescribed for & Who Can Prescribe it?

Most commonly used in addiction treatment as a form of MAT (medication assisted treatment) for those opioid dependent. It blocks full agonists which discourages use/relapse while taking it, and is known to help many people with cravings.

It is sometimes used in Pain Management, and while some do not find it to be effective in treating their chronic pain many people do find success with this treatment and benefit from bupe's good analgesic properties, which are often found best effective for pain in low doses under 1mg.

Less common, bupe is being used in some studies and medical facilities off-label in managing depression in patients with treatment resistant depression.

Buprenorphine can only be prescribed by certain physicians, requiring a special course & license in order to be able to prescribe it. It is typically prescribed by addiction specialists, pain management doctors, sometimes psychiatrists.

-Buprenorphine needs to be induced when a person is already in moderate to severe withdrawal. There is no set amount of time after your last opioid dose that you must wait, as it really relies on your symptoms, but waiting at least 24 hours is a pretty standard and safe way to go. However, you should use the COWS scale to rank your withdrawal symptoms when determining the right time to begin induction.

-If you induce bupe too soon, you can very likely experience precipitated withdrawals (PWDs). This occurs when you still have full agonist opioids on your receptors, take your bupe too soon, which then rips the full agonist off very uncomfortably and throws you into a horrible, magnified withdrawal that is worse than typical WD and can last hours.

-To induce bupe once you've determined you're ready and safe to do so, while many doctors (who drastically overprescribe) tell you to take an entire 8mg as your first dose... in my extended experience and extensive research over the years, i've found that it's best to begin with a small amount and work your way up higher as needed. A good start would be taking 1-2mg, waiting an hour to gauge how you feel before adding on, and then if your symptoms still have not subsided induce another 1-2mg every hour until you are reasonably comfortable. Its common to begin your sub use on higher doses such as 8-16mg; however it is often unnecessary to go that high and its better to get by on as low of a dose as you can stabilize on.

The Bernese Method of Induction
For those that struggle to wait the 24+ hour period of sickness before they can take sub, there is a method available that if done right will make the transition much smoother, called the Bernese Method.

This method is the use of bupe alongside your full agonist opiate for a short period, taking the bupe in micro amounts that gradually increase while your dose of full agonist gradually decreases. What this does is allows bupe to start binding to your receptors and creating a buildup, but due to the low amount and the full agonist taken on top of it you wont experience PWD while this happens. As your system begins to have bupe built up on your receptors, it makes dropping off your full agonist and all the way onto a higher dose of the bupe essentially painless.

An example of how this is done: In this example we're looking at a 5 day schedule, with bupe increasing in very small amounts while your full agonist will decrease by 20% each day. For this example lets assume your habit is 1gram of heroin per day. Here is how you could use the Bernese Method to induce bupe:

*Starting point: 1g dope, 0mg bupe

*Day 1: 0.125mg bupe, then 0.8g dope

*Day 2: 0.25mg bupe, then 0.6g dope

*Day 3: 0.5mg bupe, then 0.4g dope

*Day 4: 0.75mg bupe, then 0.2g dope

*Day 5: 1mg bupe, 0 dope. Now that you've dropped your full agonist, you can begin increasing your bupe using the same method described above for regular induction, until you reach a dose you can stabilize on.

Getting on bupe: cost; how to get a prescription;
-How to get a prescription: you can use suboxone.com or google suboxone doctors in your area. or if you have insurance you can call your provider and ask for doctors that way. Once you've found a doctor, you'll go in for an intake. Expect a UA at this, and every, visit. You must fail for opiates or buprenorphine generally in order to be scripted. As long as you go to your intake, drop a dirty UA, and pay - you should be walking out the door that day with your script. Some places will make you go weekly or biweekly at first or if you come in with dirty UAs. Some places will script you a month at a time as long as you pass your UA. It varies a little bit for each person, but many times you will start out scripted 8-16mg a day.

-Cost: This varies quite a bit, based on whether or not you have insurance and on your location. Many places will still charge a cash copay too even if you do have insurance coverage, but your script should be mostly (if not fully) covered by the insurance.

Typically an intake visit runs from around 200-350$, and then goes down in future visits to a lesser amount ranging from around 100-200$.

Without insurance, you can get the generic bupe tablets for like $3ea with coupon that is available online.

-Bonus: street cost: Some of us cannot afford to obtain a script the legitimate way, or just cant have access for whatever reason. But good thing thanks to overprescribing, the streets are flooded with subs in many areas. The price varies state to state, going from $10ea at minimum to $25ea at maximum. $15 or so could be considered the average.

Getting off bupe: proper tapering; disputing horror stories;
-Getting off bupe can be difficult, but it does NOT at all have to be what people make it out to be. If you do it the right way!

-Disputing horror stories: People often say how horrible it is to come off subs, how its worse than dope, how its not worth it to go on them at all due to the detox, that its hell etc. However, its very likely that 95% of these people did not do a proper taper. They either jumped too high, tapered too fast, or didnt taper at all and cold turkeyed it. If you do any of those things, you will have a horror story.

-Properly Tapering: Tapering off subs can be a process that takes a bit of time, patience, and committment. Its common for the taper process to take weeks or months. To find out how to taper off, ask your doctor, google the helpmegetoffdrugs suboxone taper, OR i (u/chasingd0pamine) write custom tapers for redditors so you can shoot me a message.

Routes of Administration (ROAs) & their Bioavailabilities
*The prescribed way to take it is sublingually - dissolved under the tongue. but there are other ways, which do have higher bioavailabilities. I am not suggesting anyone abuse their meds, but if you can cut your dose by using another ROA you can cut your cost and make this more affordable.

Sublingual: 30%

Intranasal: 45%

Rectal: 54%

IV: 100%

Breaking through bupe/using after bupe; recreational value
-It is extremely dangerous to try and break through your dose to get high. If you are going to use, it really depends on your bupe dose but youll typically need to wait 24-48 hours in order to get high. sometimes more if you are on a high dose of sub and have been on it for a while.

-Recreational Value: Bupe can have a recreational value to some users, but really just to those who have a very low tolerance. Remember that less is more when taking it to get high, and that it is very potent and sometimes makes people sick when they are trying to get high off it.

Suboxone maintenance: benefits; clean vs not
-Benefits: Choosing bupe is not for everyone, but it saves many lives. It is great for chronic relapsers, for those who need a stepping stone while rebuilding their lives and working recovery, for those who have pain and are also an addict, etc.

-Clean or not?: This question gets asked a lot here and there is no right answer for it. Suboxone can greatly assist in working your recovery, making personal progress, rebuilding your life, getting off dope when nothing else seems to stop you, saving your life, and so on. To those that are in NA and/or are fully abstinent from all opiates and drugs, then no they wont consider you clean. But if you are clean from your opiate abuse, from full agonists, from your addiction, and are using it as intended then that can be considered clean too.",['OTH'],0,0,0,0,0,1

185,dq7p1z,"My experience for those wanting to start.. I had tried subs off the street before but I was afraid of actually going to a clinic I though it would be a difficult and expensive process, however this is my experience.

Day0: I start calling clinics in my area to make sure they accept my insurance and try to schedule an appointment. It took about 2-3 hours of making calls but I finally found a clinic that would take my insurance and better yet they could see me the next day. I talk to the receptionist on the phone she gives me the rundown and makes me an appointment.

Day1: I wake up at 430 sick the stamp I did at 6pm the day before was pretty weak. I knew it would be shitty to make it to my appointment at 2pm but i took some NyQuil and tried to go back to sleep. I woke up again about an hour before my alarm still not feeling great but I could manage . I get ready for school and head to class. I get out of class and head to my appointment. I check in fill out my paper work and hang out a minute. They call me in for a urine sample which I've never had to do in front of somebody before . I struggled they give you three tries finally i manage and move to the next waiting room. About 5 minutes later I'm called into a room with a nurse she takes my weight and vitals and asks a few questions then dismisses me back to the waiting room. Two minutes later the Dr. Calls me in . I go in she introduced herself took my cows score she could clearly tell I was in moderate withdraw. She asked if I had ever taken subs before and about my past drug habits (oxy for a few years then heroin). I tell her everything being honest. When I used subs on the streets I always kept my doses below 8mg typically 2-4 mg per day . She's surprised to hear this. Writes my script for 7 8mg strips a week and tells me to take what I need but try to keep my dose low. Finally she recommended a pharmacy for me to go to that's close by and accepting . When I go to leave my copay is $0 so that's amazing.

Pharmacy: I walk in having no money I show the tech my script, insurance, and ask what my copay will be . He comes back a few minutes later saying $15 I don't have it so I tell him I'll have to come back . He says that he can give me 1 strip now and fill the rest and I can pay tomorrow, Fucking amazing. I take my 1 strip and dose 4mg and head home. At home I dose 2mg more and call it a night.

Day2: I wake up take the last 2mg of my 1st strip. After my class I head over to the pharmacy again with money for my prescription. I ask them about it everything is ready just pay and sign. Then out the door easy peasy.

Tldr: It was surprisingly easy and I feel relieved I did it. 15$ and a few hours was all it took. Don't be afraid to get started if you want to get on subs.

I’m not too sure how to put this. I’ve been following this sub for some time and I’ve read similar posts before, I’m not sure why I decided to post, as this probably is more of an “off my chest” post.

In a nutshell, my significant other is a few years on Suboxone. This person has my whole heart and there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for them. We’ve been together for about two years and have lived together for about 6 months. Our life together is amazing and we get along so well.

The only problem with this is the lack of sex drive.. I know the Suboxone is to blame, we’ve had countless talks about this issue, and I’ve been told it’s not me. I believe once the Suboxone is out or even tapered to a lower dose, we will get back into the swing of things. It’s been what feels like forever since we’ve actually been intimate, and this other person isn’t the most affectionate (that’s just the personality and I am okay with that) day to day. I guess I’m just feeling extremely sexually frustrated and a little neglected. I just want to feel connected and special, but I feel like I’m just a roommate. 

I feel unbelievably selfish and like a bad spouse. I’ve asked if there was anything I could do and initiate love as best I can but nothing works and my partner gets upset that the drive isn’t there. 

If anybody had a magical cure(ha ha I wish) or even some advice I am all ears.

196,dtxzfw,"Made another vlog, I decided to drop the liquid taper as it wasn’t working for me and go back to regular dosing- here’s what I’ve learned.. So this has been a roller coaster of a few days guys and after my post yesterday, and crying in the vlog I made, I decided to make a decision and go back to what I knew. I decided to go back to regular tapering with the subutext pills and weighing them out and putting them under my tongue the old way. (Not doing the alcohol/water taper)

Here’s the vlog about switching back to regular dosing, it’s very short : https://youtu.be/AdsDIdHHacg

Here’s what I talk about in it (but here with a lot more depth, I didn’t cover all I wanted) 

Basically six days ago I tried to switch to a liquid taper with the alcohol- I went down from 0.60 to 0.52, such a low drop that I didn’t think I would have ANY problems bc of the higher bioavailability and what people said : increased absorption rate. But after careful consideration and after a lot of thought and obsessing and taking my regular dose this morning 0.52 with the pill under my tongue: I can tell you a couple things. 

First I believe that I was able to take my pill and put it in my mouth and fall asleep- pretty easy as I put my pill by my bed- this makes me have my mouth dry, sleep through any slight wd, and wake up feeling like I was good. But with the volumetric dosing I had to wake up- go pull the water out put it in my mouth and try not to spill any and keep my head back bc water/alcohol moves around a lot (I also could not fall back asleep). It’s hard to keep the water and alcohol one place in my mouth- and even if I held it fourty five minutes like I do taking it the old way-  I still felt significant withdrawals. I also could  not fall back asleep bc the wd were so bad- and it would take about 2 hours to kick in! I never felt this the regular way of taking it. I also would accumulate a lot of saliva bc of the alcohol- it just would start pooling the minute I put it under my tongue. I changed back to regular dosing and I really felt my dose this morning- even though I did not change it from my liquid dose. Which means I wasn’t absorbing the liquid dose as well. I think bc of how much suffering I was having, that I was not absorbing any where near the 0.52 mg because of the saliva that would happen right away bc of the alcohol. Before I knew any of this I also wondered if it was the liquid taper causing me to have to go to split dosing- I was able to dose once before and never had any problems in the afternoon like I was on the liquid taper. I also now believe that this was from the fact that I was not absorbing it like I was the pill.  I also believe that I will have to move down from this dose Tommorow (taking it the regular way)  as it’s too much! 

This has all really thrown me for a loop, I went into this believing that I would be able to absorb it in 10 minutes, that I would feel the full dose and it would be better than taking it the old way. But for me that was wrong, I also want to make sure that i don’t put anyone off it. I think it can be a great tool- and I wonder if doing it with just water would have been a much better way. I’m not sure, but I wasn’t willing to keep going the way I was or even willing to try it with just water. I was so upset, so on edge, withdrawing so much. And I couldn’t figure it out and I kept trying to wait it out. I’m glad I didn’t wait it out. I made it six days and I’m happy I tried it. But some things work for some people and other things don’t. 

But I’ve learned a lot and I am willing at this point to taper the way I had been- I also had not had significant withdrawals in any of my previous tapers doing it the regular way. 

Anyways I want to thank you guys for commenting and being so supportive about my post yesterday, it really helped me a lot. You guys have been so important to the success I’ve had so far, and I couldn’t have done any of it without you!","['TP', 'MA', 'PPE']",0,1,1,0,1,0

207,dz8h16,"Energy from subs. I hear a lot of people saying they get energy from Suboxone when they take it. And if you ask me (I'm just a regular guy who's had a lot of experience with subs) I'd say that there lays a problem. You should not be getting energy from your medication. The medication is designed to help you establish that energy that you already have/had. If you are getting your energy from the Suboxone itself then you are still not ready to give up the habits that come with taking street drugs. You have to exercise and eat right and take care of yourself. This medication is not designed for you to just take and expect great outcomes. This is what gives Suboxone a stigma and turns people off to the idea. It is also not recommended to stay on the medication for longer than 6 months. In some cases people may need longer. All I'm getting at is do not rely on your Suboxone script to get you motivated to do something. Even washing the dishes or putting your pants on is a struggle when you're withdrawing. But you gotta get yourself up out of that hole, you can do it. Suboxone is just a crutch.",['PPE'],0,0,1,0,0,0
208,e0228q,"Testosterone replacement therapy. Hello,
I started taking suboxone about a year ago and I have since experienced fatigue, loss of motivation and libido, depression and excessive sleeping.
I've just got my testosterone levels rested and they came back low, 4.6 nmol/l (ref 8.6-29 nmol/l).
I'm now waiting to get an appointment with a endocrinologist to start testosterone replacement therapy.

I have high hopes in the therapy and hopes that it will resolve the issues I've stated above because I really don't want to quit subs.

Is there anyone on the sub who have received testosterone replacement therapy? Did it help?

228,earw5s,"RLS FML. So I’m at the end of a pretty short taper from 4mg to 0.5mg. This taper took 5 weeks and I was on 0.5mg for just 6 days when I jumped. Ideally the taper would’ve been longer and less aggressive but it’s very difficult for me to get subs and I had a limited supply for this taper. 
60 hours after my last 0.5mg dose I was going insane with the restless legs syndrome. It felt like RLS inducing juice was being poured into my body and affecting every part of it.

 My knees (mainly), and my elbows, wrists, ankles and lower back were all affected. The rls was so strong that it was causing the affected areas to spasm on their own whenever I was able to resist the urge to move them. 

Remaining still for longer than 5-10 seconds was extremely difficult. I had to use all my mindfulness meditation skills to resist the urge to move and the urges were coming in constant waves. I was sitting on a crowded train during some of this and I had to get off the train and wait 30 mins for the next one (twice) because I was going insane being amongst a crowd. 

Sleep was impossible. I only had valerian and chamomile to help with sleep which had no affect but I don’t want to use any chemical formulas to help me through this if possible. 

In desperation for sleep I started searching through my old stash hideaways looking for a stray sub film. I’d already done this when I started my taper so I would know exactly how much I had in order to plan my taper. I’d also repeated the search nearing the end of the taper once it became clear I was going to be uncomfortable stepping off from 0.5mg. During these searches of my room I had a nagging feeling that there was a strip or two hiding somewhere. 

 In a small box that had somehow previously gone un-searched I found 13 x 2mg films that must’ve been sitting there for more than a year. I felt like I’d won the lottery. 
I immediately sliced and took a 0.5mg piece and waited nearly an hour. My frustration at not getting immediate relief caused me to take another 0.5mg piece. That did the trick. The rls stopped, I crashed. I then woke up around 40 mins later and was awake for about 6 hours with that speedy amphetamine feeling bupe can cause. Bupe also causes me to have very vivid dreams (which are actually realistic nightmares of an R and X rated nature) and they reappeared with this obviously too strong 1mg dose. 

Anyway now I have an unexpected supply of 25mg of bupe (12 and a half x 2mg strips of suboxone) and I am able to plan a longer taper from 0.5mg to whatever it takes. I guess it’ll go something like:

 10 days @ 0.500mg. (5mg)

 10 days @ 0.375mg.  (3.75mg)

 10 days @ 0.250mg.  (2.50mg)

 10 days @ 0.200mg (2mg)

 10 days @ 0.150mg (1.5mg)

 10 days @ 0.100mg. (1mg)

10 days @ 0.075mg (0.750mg)

Total used 16.50mg. 

If I’m successful up to this point I should still have 9mg left to continue the taper if needed. 

My question to anyone in this sub forum who has bothered to read this is this; if I had not found those extra films of sub how long would that RLS have lasted? 

Also has anyone who has experienced severe opiate/buprenorphine withdrawal RLS found that the syndrome is less powerful when a longer taper is used? If I jump from 0.100 mg will the symptoms be of shorter duration than they were at my 0.500mg jump?. 


Any tips for relief from the syndrome would also be appreciated (I’m not going to use the Parkinson’s medication that has been successful for others). 

I feel like I can endure any other physical withdrawal symptom this shit throws at me. The RLS feels almost unbearable though and would Likely be the cause of me relapsing back onto opiates if it doesn’t end.

My habit was 0.3 - 0.5g Heroin through my nose or smoked, daily, for about half a year.

Tuesday, about 18 hours later when I was in WD I used 4mg Subutex. Didn‘t give me lots of relief. 
Wednesday I felt quite hellish, So I took a whole 8mg. It gave relief, not 100%, but I was feeling ok. 

But now is the next morning, no 18 hours after I took those 8 mg, and I feel pretty bad again.

Subutex worked like a miracle drug last time I used it. And I needed much less.

232,eeja24,"Confused about Extended Withdrawal of Suboxone but Short Blocking Period of Other Opiates. The lengthy withdrawal of suboxone is pretty well-discussed across this form and other places on the internet. What I don't understand is if Suboxone has such a long withdrawal period due to its high half-life, why are people able to use illicit opiates (oxy, heroin, etc) only 24-72 hours after their last dose?  

From what I can tell, its the bupe (not naloxone) that occupies the opioid receptors in your brain which block other opiates (oxy, heroin, etc) from having any euphoric effect if you try to use them on suboxone. Thus, as you're coming off suboxone, your opiate receptors will slowly have less and less of the drug in place to block opiates (which starts to cause withdrawal symptoms). Does this mean one could use an illicit opioid as soon as the suboxone withdrawal period starts to kick in to full effect? I assume this would provide temporary relief from withdrawal symptoms but only for a few hours or so (as oxy / heroin have much shorter half lives than subs) and then the regular suboxone withdrawal would resume once the illicit opiate wore off? Would there be any precipitated withdrawal if somebody then went back on suboxone after doing this?  

I've read some about people going back and forth between their sub treatment and using oxy / heroin and just wondering how this plays out. If you're on sub treatment and slip up and use oxy / heroin, can you then resume your regular suboxone treatment? Or will that throw you into precipitated withdrawal?

236,eg1ye6,"Thank You, Suboxone.. My addiction started 7 years ago at age 22. My attempt to quit started 3 years ago. I would go 14 days, relapse. 30 days, relapse. Then I found Kratom. It allowed me to hit my longest streak - 60 days - but then, yup, relapse.

2 years ago I went overseas for 4 months to get clean. I felt great sober - back to my old, laughing, smiling self. 4 months clean! Yet I relapsed a week after coming back.

Fast forward a year of using, my parents found out (again). Send me abroad again (Middle East). This time she begged me to see a specialist. I was reluctant. I knew what he was going to do - put me on Suboxone. I thought to myself, ""Why would I get on suboxone, considering I'm already a month clean?"" 

Then I realized why. The relapses. The going to work in Withdrawal. The embarrassment of my boss finding me nodded out at my desk. The trust I lost with my parents, my brothers, myself. The complete stall in my career. The $12 in my bank account, when I was making $800 a week. The waking up in misery. That deep, dark, gut feeling that withdraw is coming. So so many reasons.

I saw the doctor in May and began Suboxone, along with therapy. A month later I flew back home. This time I was stronger, thinking clearer. I'm happy to say it'll soon be 8 months away from Heroin & Oxy. I turn 30 next week, so I'm happy to leave the drug use in my 20s.

I'm not sure I would have done it without Suboxone, & the lessons of therapy. I owe my life to this medication. I have thousands saved, not working yet but studying for my Internal Audit certificate.

My drugs of choice before the subs were Gabapentin (huge doses) and Kratom (also huge doses).  I tried for months to stop using them but couldn’t.

I never craved drugs when taking it.  This was the good part.  Now the bad

I have been a lifelong addict.  I’m an alcoholic, had past addiction problems to sleeping pills and other meds.  I found with my subs that if I just took both daily doses at once, it made me feel great.  So I did.  Then several months in to my use, I decided to try tapering.  But it never stuck.  I’d use the normal amount early in the month and have to make up for it with smaller doses at the end.  Each month got worse.  I’d get stuck “in the hole” month after month.  Now pretty much running out days early and going through the beginnings of withdraw every month until I got more.  I just can’t control it.  Every month I say I will, but I never do.

Last spring, I'd almost died. Had endocarditis,  MRSA pneumonia,  septic arthritis and discitis.  I went into full septic shock- multiple pulmonary  embolisms, blood sugar of 369, BP 70/30, fever for weeks that stopped out around 104°F. I was lifeflighted and hospitalized for two months,  had to do PT/OT to stand/walk/function again. During my hospitalization and convalescent care,  I received close to 30 RBC blood transfusions for severe anemia (H/H of 3-4.0) as well. 

That was last March.  I came home end of May. However , ever since my hospitalization I have this cycle of feeling fine for about two weeks,  then I am hit with exhaustion like a ton of bricks and sleep for 2-4 days straight no matter how hard I try not to. Likely I need a valve replacement,  but I finally just got clean and on subs about 8 weeks ago.

Has anyone here had similar health issues and subsequent exhaustion?  

I am having much difficulty getting anything done ( still haven't followed up with PCP- at ALL, and am missing 2/3 days of outpatient every 3rd week or so). I am really beating myself up about it too. I feel lazy and useless. I also have a severe cold intolerance as well (H/H is normal though around 10-12) so I'm finding even leaving my house to be trying as well now.

Anyone who can relate or make suggestions, I'd be greatly appreciative.  Feel free to DM me if you prefer. TIA


Edit to add: Endocarditis is very closely associated with IDU (IV Drug Use).  80% o the tricuspid valve infections, as opposed to  the mitral,aortic... occurs in IDUs. Basically,*  if you  get endocarditis and have tricuspid damage, its 8/10 chance you're an IDU.*

I'm on bupe following a lengthy IV heroin addiction.  Since it's hard to keep tabs on your health when you're in active addiction, or really know how you're affected physically once drugs are taken off the table, I figured that a suboxone sub (a sub sub lol) would give me a good shot, no pun intended , at finding IDUs  who are in recovery and on bupe mmt  following an Opiate Use Disorder.

This is my fist post here so please bear with me If anything goes against reddit traditional rules :)

4 Months ago I switched from suboxone to full opiates in order to to an ibogaine treatment in December (ibogaine doesn’t work well if the suboxone is still in your system)... Ever since the ibogaine, I’ve had very little sleep - but when I do, I have crazy real dreams, some of which I’ve learned aren’t actually dreams... sleep walking, texting, sleep eating etc. 

Today I woke up with an opened (and likely consumed) 4mg suboxone tab package. I have no recollection of taking it (and am mind blown as to how I found it, since I (thought) I got rid of all drugs. I’m very worried that I might get withdrawal but I know one dose normally wouldn’t do that.

I’ve been feeling better everyday. Still get a little sweaty and clammy, stomach is a little off, sleep is minimum. But the biggest bombshell for me was how much suboxone numbed me to everything. Even things I used to love to do I would just be going through the motions when I was on suboxone. It could be just me but in as little as five days off, everything is coming back to me. I have that passion again about my hobbies and life that I didn’t have on suboxone.

Was overprescribed 20mg per day and then cut off at the 5th month of treatment,  insurance company crap. No relapses,  no oxycodone  cravings.  I'm using  4mg strips and am cutting them up in .5 and .25 mg pieces.  I've never felt good on suboxone and want to eliminate withdrawal.  I tried a 7day inpatient subutex detox and failed,  too fast. So here I sit at 1.75mg per day,  been here a week but still feel  pretty bad. My intention was to level out and then drop 
 a total of  .25mg, and allow a week or so in between  drops.

I've read that the strips ARE NOT EVENLY COVERED WITH THE BUPRENORPHINE.  If this is correct,  it would explain (maybe) why I sometimes feel rough and sometimes feel real rough.  Would volumetric dosing be the best approach? I've read about using a oral dosing  syringe,  (and yes I'm good at math) for all dosing below 2mg.

Also, I dose twice per day. Should I work at removing one of those doses to a one per day dosing schedule?

I literally  couldn't do the 7day subutex detox that insurance paid for. My body is old and frail at the moment. Maybe I've contaminated my game plan with stinking thinking.

Moved from 40mg methadone daily for 3+ years to 8mg a day on Jan 13th this year. I waited over 72 hours to dose and experienced minor pwds but after about a week they declined. About the 20th of Jan I reduced my dose to 4 mg a day and everything seemed fine until about a week ago when I started to experience pain in my left side, left back side, right side and would experience stomach discomfort akin to indigestion.

I never have had a internal pain like this so I stopped taking the subs for about 36 hours and noticed the pain subsiding somewhat but I started feeling sick of course so rather than take 2mg orally as I had been all along I took 2mg via insuffulation and so far no pain. Thought maybe mucus membranes would help and maybe it was getting into my stomach and kidneys? or liver? ( I know they SAY sublingual ROA is non haptic but your liver still metabolizes it through your blood)

I have had blood work at the Mdone clinic  a few months ago and they said all my labs were ok. I went to urgent care yesterday who thought kidney stones but got a CT scan and came back negative. 

My prescribing Dr. said today he thinks I could still be withdrawing from the MDone and its still interacting with the Subs .....I don't know wtf is going on! I just know I'm not going back to MDone and cant function on nothing!

So has been wanting to get off subs for a year and finally found the courage, after all my research and pep talks. The first day he was groggy, minimal physical WD symptoms, more so anxiety and worries. We spent all day laying in bed, talking it out and rubbing his back to calm him down. Yesterday was day 4 and I had “the notebook” on when he got out of the shower. He’s usually impartial to sappy movies but he sat down and watched it. We got to the end and he was like, “my emotions feel weird, I was this close to crying at the end”. This is coming from someone who admitted he didn’t cry at the most recent funeral he attended. 

He’s usually affectionate but what I’m dealing with now is something else, he has been the BIGGEST sweetheart, constantly holding my hand, snuggling, talking about our future in the sweetest ways, just overall different. Better different. 

The best part: I’m usually initiating sex, I’ll usually throw my hand over his junk and start rubbing, it’ll either take a while for him to pitch a tent or he’ll tell me he’s not in the mood. But yesterday I did it, immediate hard on, he made more noises which were reassuring, more grabbing and squeezing while I went down for a couple minutes and the second I hopped on it wasn’t even a minute and he blew. Super sensual cuddling to follow. Afterwards he was in shock how much he enjoyed it and sat back and said “I’m starting to feel more, and it feels good, this is good, I think I’m gonna be alright”. 

He’s been off and on putting this process off, he’s expressed desire to do this but was terrified of being without it. I knew this is what it would be like and I wanted it so bad for him and for us, but I never shoved, only gave patient suggestions and unconditional love and support for him goin at his own pace. I feel so happy for him and wanted to share with anyone struggling his story to show it can be done. He was SO scared for this and it’s all panning out wonderfully.

It is very frustrating bcuz I feel like there are so many complications-
I’ll salivate too much, it’ll start leaking into my mouth so I feel like I can’t swallow it, ppl will try talking to me at my rehab when my mouth is full of saliva and subs, etc.

Just in case ... 


So I’ve been on suboxone for awhile now and haven’t had any issues besides just wanting to finally be done with this crap. 
Last night some friends came into town and they HMU around 11 and asked if I wanted to play pool and have a few drinks. Ok, no problem. Well let me go back a few hours. After the kids got out of school, we got all the cousins together and swam and watched tv and mom and sis-in-law and I had a few drinks. They left around 8ish and then around 11 I went out. We had a few drinks and they decided they wanted to get a bottle and go hang out at the place they were staying.  Now by now it’s past one and my head is pounding! Red wine, tequila and crown and coke def don’t fucking mix ever... 
So we get to their place and I grabbed sum water (they got vodka and OJ and there was no way I could mix that. 
Then it happened ... “heeyyyyy guess what we have! Bitch we got beans from Miami! These are sooo good.. “  Just an FYI I’ve got vast knowledge of all things drug related especially psychedelics.. so I’m skeptical... why? Bc the shit now sucks ass! So I’m like “idk i don’t really want too but... “ 
Anyhow obviously I took it. Got SUPER HOT! In like 30 mins everyone’s feeling great and rolling around and I’m like “this blows my head hurts and no I don’t want u to touch me” I got up a few times and walked outside and shit and then after about an hour I just wanted to go home. I wasn’t feeling it and really just felt bad. 
I get home 2 mins later and started throwing up. I actually haven’t stopped!! I puked SO MUCH and my eyes just ran water out of them I was sweating super bad and freezing my ass off. Only time I felt anything is once I stood up after puking a shit ton and had to pee and realized everything was super blurry and shit. 
I usually take both subs around 6 but at 530 I was like god I need to take a sub but I only took one bc I had been puking all night. So I did and not a minute and a 1/2 later I puked again but fell asleep!! Woke up sick , definitely not rolling and I had to take my second bc I basically ruined my first one.
Anyhow yes I know the alcohol had something to do with it as well but I was seriously on deaths door for a few hours. I remember stumbling to the bathroom
to pee and had to grab the trash bc I was gunna puke and my stomach was not happy with me.

310,derl5r,"Day 7 without subs.. It’s been a week- LETS GOOO!!. Figured I’d write a little synopsis of my first week off of Suboxone. I was taking 1 mg for around a year. Been on subs for 2. I made the jump from 1 to none- and it hasn’t been that bad.

 Honestly, this subreddit had me in my head. 
It seems like it’s literal hell for a lot of people. 
Sure it hasn’t been the best week ever, but not the worst either. 
Body wise, it’s trying to regulate temperature like normal && that’s probably the most uncomfortable part for me. Feeling hot and cold all at once, it comes in waves. All day- all week. 
Definitely messing with my sleep. Went to bed at 11 pm and woke up at 2 am this morning D: 
But I mean... overall- I’m so fucking happy. I’m so stoked I was able to do this. My birthdays next month, it’s about to be 2020, I’m just ready to fuck shit up for the better and say bye bye to these little orange pills that were changing me in more ways than I realized during that couple of years.
The most noticeable change for me- was having zero sex drive. It was bizarre. I’m a Scorpio chick.. mid 20’s. It felt wrong, I already feel it comin back and I’m here for it && not getting any younger. I don’t know- it was like the suboxone was able to completely disconnect me from the thing they call the sacral chakra. 

Other than that, I alienated myself quite a bit I’d say. I already feel more sociable and less anxious. I’ve been laughing, resting, painting, going for walks, staying up late when I can’t sleep and grinding some good ol GTA. Been eating lots of food too- drinking water & I think Vitamin C has helped significantly. The first couple evenings I made some Kratom tea- seemed to help just a bit but I haven’t needed to since.
I’m just happy. And free.
And I’d encourage anyone who’s trying to move on from Suboxone- to give yourself more credit in realizing how strong we have became over everything we’ve gone through. And I’d have to say the heroin withdrawals were vastly more excruciating than that of Suboxone. You got this. 
Don’t over think it like me. 

Anyway vibes y’all. Cheers to letting go of physical dependence on things. Peace out ✌️🤟🏼 Week 2 LETS GOOOOO","['TP', 'PPE']",0,0,1,0,1,0

 But I'm so depressed when I wake up, like SUPER depressed and it's starting to compound.

320,dk3zvj,"Subutex Taper -- please advise!. Hi There,

First time visitor/poster to this subreddit. Just wanted to get some feedback on what I can expect self-tapering from 8mg to 4mg of 'Subutex (buprenorphine with NO naloxone).

I've been taking bupe since the end of 2016 and am so happy to say I never had a relapse on dope or painkillers since then! It's a straight up miracle. First I was taking 16mg, then I brought myself to 12mg, then 8mg.. I've been on 8mg for months now and I started taking bupe every other day instead of daily and its been more or less fine. I would dose once I started to feel sweaty. I asked my doctor to help me get off subutex as I am sick of the nasty taste and I'm sick of being so dependent on a medication.

5 months ago I got off Klonopin after 12 years of dependency on that shit,  I just want to be free from controlled substances. I feel like I can't truly be  free unless I'm off these habit-forming medications. My doctor doesn't think coming off subs is a good idea right now, mostly because subutex has worked so well on me. I'm still in ""early recovery"" from the benzos, and he is wary about making too many big changes at the same time.

I decided to test the waters and break my subutex in half - 4mg every other day. I started doing this like 4 days ago. I noticed last night I had no appetite and needed to go lay down due to feeling nauseous. Am I imagining this? 8mg to 4mg shouldn't be a big deal, right?  I do not have my expectations or facts straight so I am turning to you guys--  Is 8mg to 4mg Subutex a big jump? How severe would withdrawal symptoms be? Am I making a big mistake disobeying my doctor? And lastly, where do I go from here? Thank you guys so much for reading and god bless.","['TP', 'MA', 'PPE']",0,1,1,0,1,0

322,dkrg8r,"Precipitated Withdrawals. Howdy, ya'll!  So I have been using dope, far more than I'd like (I recently got back up to 100mg day for a short while), and I want to get myself onto suboxone.  I haven't found a doctor willing to help me, the one doc I found prescribing suboxone wouldn't treat me due to baclofen and clonazepam prescriptions that I genuinely need for symptoms of transverse myelitis, and last time I tried suboxone I also only had 8 pills worth and the person who was supposed to get me more flaked.  It did allow me to get off dope though, and I was clean for over a month but I couldn't find a pain doctor willing to prescribe me opioids and I was tired of having my pain limit my mobility so I started using again.  

I have since gotten 22 more pills of suboxone and I believe a more steady supply in general, the thing is I'm scared as hell of having another precipitated withdrawal which I had the first time.  I was using about 120-150mg a day back then, I waited about 12 hours which had me having notable withdrawal symptoms (I'm a wuss I guess), I took 2mg of suboxone and I got real close to needing to go to the ER.  I thankfully had someone with me who was able to help try to keep me hydrated, but I was sweating so badly and losing consciousness while laying flat, it was insane.  I don't want to experience that again, holy hell.

So I'm aiming to do less than 65mg today, I'm lowering my dope and adding kratom, and I'm wondering how low/long of abstinence you all would feel comfortable going before making the jump.  I was hoping it would be relatively okay to do 1mg to see how I react if I could manage 24 hours of kratom only, but I've also heard a lot of the fentanyl cut dope has people going through PWs like 3 damn days later.  This most certainly has fent in it. 

**TLDR**:  I'm scared to go through PWs again, I have health problems in general wearing me down right now and I don't think my body can really take another beating like that right now, what would you recommend to avoid them?   Can I take kratom leading up to suboxone without getting PWs?  

Also, I wonder if any doctors prescribe morphine or something for a few days before switching their patient to suboxone, then they can avoid this ridiculous shit if it's true how bad the fent reaction is.

My life is really great. I've been through so much in my life. My mother took her own life, ive experienced so much death and sadness kn my life. Depression and bipolar is in my genetics. 

Ive been one of those people that just refuses to quit and keep going as shit piles on. 

I currently have a great job, most beautiful spouse on the planet, baby on the way. But something is off.

Ive been smoking weed since I was 12. Daily. I got caught up in pills and oxy growing up, multiple surgeries. I started taking suboxone about 10 years ago. It helped me be free again. I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO A DOCTOR FOR THIS. 1 strip lasts me a week.

I currently have a new job offer and they drug test. I want this so bad for my family. I want to be the father I know I can be, and will be. I love how they make me feel. I don't think I am ready to stop just yet. I have quit smoking weed now for a few days and feel okay.

This drug test is for a car dealership, much bigger than the one I am at. If I detox off weed and stay on the subs, do I stand a chance? I do not have a doctors script, or insurance to quickly get one. 

I've tried so hard to keep my life in order despite the things that I've had to overcome. No one knows about my sub use other than my old best friend who I get them from once a month. I take 1 a week and literally have it down to hardly anything. 

I am so worried I will fail this drug test for a sliver of subs. I heard most don't test for subs. But how can I be sure?

326,dmbtkf,"I owe my life to Suboxone (round 2)..  I started taking pain pills in 2002.  The first oxy I took I hated it. I was prescribed Percocet once before that and felt that it made me mean and I gave them away. I couldn’t for the life of me understand why someone would want them.  Needless to say these guys at work loved me. I didn’t know at the time people used them to get high. Shoot I was so innocent at the time I didn’t even know what “getting high” meant. 
   
Fast forward to about 2003 and I got my wisdom teeth pulled and again was prescribed Percocet, this time it was different though. This time I remember getting the warmest feeling I had ever had in my life. I curled up in my girlfriends lap and she fed me Percocet as prescribed on the bottle and I was in heaven. A couple days pass and my dentist calls and checks up up on me. I managed to round up a refill out of him even tho I didn’t need it. I was hooked. 
   
From 2003-2008 I was out of control. I was spending every extra dime I had on oxy 40’s. I ruined the relationship I referred to earlier because I wanted to party. I had a son in 2006 and somehow managed to be there for the child. I can’t count the number of sleepless nights from withdrawals and then having a screaming baby wake me up at 5am. I also managed to keep a job for 14 years. It was a miracle. 
   
I got a DUI (alcohol) in the midst of this (2006) and got put on probation while hooked on pills. I went to jail for a week for having Hydrocodone in my system. They let me out and I quickly went right back to the pills. One night I was in withdrawals and the only thing that helped was alcohol. I met up with a bartender and me and her got drunk and I ended up doing meth with her. I stumble in the door at 7am just in time for my sons mom to go to work and BOOM my probation officer calls, 
   
I gotta go in for a drop. I know if I pee dirty  again I’m gone (jail) for a few months at least. So I called my P.O. and i laid it all out on the line. I tell her I’m sick. So sick that If it weren’t  for my son I would have put a gun to my head. 
  
Not even a week later I’m on my first dose of suboxone and I can’t believe it. I do take them as prescribed and my life slowly comes back together. This is about 2008. I make it through my probation which was actually Drug Court after a 4-year ordeal. 
   
Fast forward to 2013 and I’m now prescribed Xanax on top of the Suboxone. For some reason I had 3 docs (they all knew each other) that didn’t see a problem with this combination. However, who does have a problem with this is a cop that pulls me over and takes me in for a blood draw. I’m DUI (xanax) and my 5-year-old son was in the back seat.  Somehow I avoided a neglect charges and maintained joint custody. They said if I had not had a valid prescription I would have lost him.  
   
I am forced into rehab and I quit subs and Xanax in a 7-day-detox and then onto  a 30-day outpatient rehab. I complete the rehab and stay off subs. What happens the next year of my life is beyond comprehension. 
   
I’m shooting heroin daily and I have random junkies flopping in house every night. I see my son less and less. He lives with his mom full time now because I sure as hell can’t take care of him beyond a couple days a week. This whole time I’m on probation again for the Xanax DUI. I manage to get clean for the pee tests and on the way home from the tests I’m on the phone with Dope man. 
   
This continues from Sep 2013 they Dec 2015. I violate probation because I get caught passed out in Meijer parking lot huffing air duster. You see I was out of dope and I heard that huffing would take the edge off, and it did somewhat. Anyways I get another charge for huffing and they violate me. My only choice is rehab, again. 
If I had not chose rehab I would have went to prison. 

This time I take it serious though. I ask for Suboxone because I know it’s my only hope. I WILL DIE  if I walk out of that facility without it. I do another 6 month outpatient along with a 3-month jail sentence (work release ).  
   
This time something changed, something clicked in my head. I move away from the city and back to my hometown. I had to push the reset button on my life. I was reborn. I sat at home and reconnected with myself and my family.  I cut off all the toxic relationships in my life and I got a new phone number. 
   
Fast forward to 2018 and I finally feel strong enough to put myself out there and take a chance.  I quit the job that was the cause of my stress and anxiety ( not to mention filled with pill heads) and find a new job. I enroll myself back in college and I file for custody of my child. All of this while still taking suboxone. 
   
I’m taking suboxone along with a blood pressure pill and a pill for nightmares. No more anxiety meds. I’ll tell you what opiate withdrawals are a walk in the park compared to Xanax withdrawals. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone no matter how much I despise them. 
   
As of today I am on the deans list at school (A’s) and I have sole physical custody of my child. I work full time and I have my own house. My son gets straight A’s also. I will graduate with a degree in Robotics next summer. None of this would be possible without Suboxone. All of you that wanna chastise those that choose to stay on subs go ahead and continue with that self righteous BS. What works for some may not work for other.  
   
Suboxone is my lifeline and it will be until I choose for it not to be. I’m a better person today than i was when I quit taking it. For anyone that feels like they are cheating by taking subs ask yourself, what does it really matter? All that matters is that you become the best you, that you can be. If it takes suboxone to do that than so be it.

As I said in the title, there's a big discrepancy day to day when taking taking my strips. Some days I get a strong buzz, which I appreciate because I take my subs in the afternoon when I have to get kids on the bus, run errands, and so on. This also gives me a break from my chronic pain. But some days when I take my strip, I feel almost no change at all.

I know that if you eat or drink while dissolving a strip it will wash away. Or it may dissolve too quickly and be swallowed.

I don’t know what to do because I’m scared to take too much. They recommended to try and do 4-8mg a day more leaning on 8mg for the whole day. Will taking more help with this?

336,hxmd1x,"Low doses. Ok so I wanna give my 2 cents about subs was on them for over 3 years and am currently again on them anyway iv been on every dose even hairs off strips I gotta say less is more but the problem is getting to that less if you’re an addict you gotta ween down and stay there for at least a. Few days to get full effects. 

Also another thing I wanna mention when taking less than 4mg i have personally in my experience noticed it takes longer to work sometimes it takes a full 90 minutes when taking a low dose I used to wake up sick and take a hair off a strip and not be high for a few hours. Obviously I don’t get high anymore off subs. That was before I did heroin.

“Snorting subs”
Yes it’s possible you mix with water in a spoon only a drop of water and don’t use a toothpick to mix it up it absorbs the bup.

“Adding up doses”
The reason imo it works better in low doses is it’s a full agonist below 4 mg also it lets your tolerance go away 8 mg of subs will build a ceiling less than 6 is the way to go. Obviously if you don’t want to get high don’t do this but personally idc I like them and it’s better than me dying from an overdose If people judge they judge fuck em!

“The best dose”
Everybody wants to know this I am no doctor this is my experience I was much happier taking literal hairs off a strip everyday than taking 4 a day it’s a weird drug. Google “suboxone receptor chart” on google images the less receptors sat on by bupenorphine the better the only way to get high on subs or if you did before and want to again is to lower the dose to below half an 8 mg strip a day. The best dose in my opinion is between 0.25mg and 2mg in my experience anything over 2 mg doesn’t give the buzz you want.

Also feel free to comment im just a guy lol I’m sure iv missed some shit but I have done a lot of research over the years but I’m 25 I’m sure others have more experience so feel free to put your experiences in replies👍👍👍

It was prescribed for pain, not for opiate addiction (even though I have used opi's recreationally and been addicted in the past).  I used to get a nice high from it when I first started taking it, but of course that didn't last, as expected.  I know the saying goes with subs/bupe that ""less is more"" and that there is a ceiling to its effects.  I can concur with all of that in my limited experience with it.  But I also know that it's *possible* to OD on it, though not easy.  

So I'm curious what would happen if one were to just keep taking more bupe.  Like what would happen if a person were to just keep popping another 2mg every hour or two and kept doing that all day and night long?  Would there be any of the ""classic"" opi euphoria?

348,iuogrl,"40 days off suboxone. 40 days off suboxone 

Just wanted to add some (mostly) positivity to the pot here. I’ve been reading through these subreddits the past couple of months and it’s helped immensely in feeling not alone in this. 

A short background: got hooked on Oxy’s almost 4 years ago after having over a year of clean time. Ended up getting in deeper than I had before (I had been more of a weekender popping pills and doing coke before the last run). Anyways, couldn’t afford the habit anymore so a hookup/buddy started selling me some his subs and I was pretty naive about what they were at the time. I just knew they helped me feel ‘normal’ and I could make a pill last several days as opposed to blowing through several Oxys a day. Little did I know this would become an even bigger monkey on my back. So after months of scoring subs off the street I finally got a doc and of course he prescribed me like 4x what I had been taking. I was soon taking 12 mg a day with a doc that had no interest in getting me off. He likened it to being my ‘insulin’ now. I had fucked my brain up according to him and would never be normal again. 

But I didn’t feel ‘normal’ on subs after a while. I didn’t like having to take something in the morning to just function like everybody else in the world. And I was starting to get side effects like a non existent sex drive, bad anxiety, mood swings that were all affecting the relationships in my life. I almost became a recluse. I tried tapering on my own but it seemed impossible. I now know I was going to fast. I was scared, terrified I’d be on this shit forever. 

I finally found another doctor over a year ago who helped me start a slow taper. Now, I had a stash of extra subs set aside that helped me through the jumps. He basically dropped me 2 mg at a time until we hit 2 mg. I did not follow this exactly. I went much more gradually using my extra subs to bridge the 2 mg drops. I wrote down what I took and when I took it religiously in a notebook for well over a year. I can’t recommend this enough as it will help show your progress the times when you feel stuck. And keep you accountable. At 1 mg I couldn’t stabilize. I read about other people having this issue. I had felt BAD the last several months. Hot flashes, mood swings, anxiety. I had put a few holes in the wall fighting with my girlfriend. I couldn’t take another several months of tapering. And when I started taking more than the 1 mg again to get me through that’s when I made the decision...I jumped. 

Now 1 mg is still a pretty significant dose. I’ve heard people here jumping from way higher but also much, much lower. I’m a pretty sensitive individual, strong minded but fairly sensitive to pain. I can tell you confidently if I can do this, you can too! Sub withdrawal is a mental battle. The first 10 days were the worst physically by far. The fatigue was crippling. I could barely stand the first week. The next couple weeks the pain relented slightly but the depression kicks in. It’s a battle. Looking back I feel SO much better on day 40 then I did at day 2 or 3 but it’s so slow it’s almost imperceptible. I still get anxiety, still have stomach issues, still feel my skin crawling when I wake up. It’s uncomfortable but it’s tolerable now. It comes in waves and I have moments in the day when I feel like myself again and moments when I ask when will this end!?? But I keep putting one foot in front of the other. I know I’m through the worst of it now and even if I have to feel bad for a couple more months, it’s a price to pay for freedom. 

As far as supplements that have helped:

Chlonidine: really does take the edge off, especially when you’re past the worst of the acute symptoms. Mostly took it at night. 

Kratom: this can be a crutch and easily turn into another addiction if you let it so...BE CAREFUL. I used larger doses (5-9grm) once to twice a day to get some relief during the first 10 days. After that I dropped to once a day and kept dropping down till I was maybe taking 2-3 grams in the morning and was able to jump off it relatively easily after a few weeks. Key was really spacing doses out 12 to 24 hours so my body/brain didn’t get used to it and I could continue healing 

Ashwaganda: started taking this a week ago and it’s really helped return my sleep cycle to almost back to normal. 

DLPA: been taking since I jumped and think it might have helped a bit with the depression, no way of really knowing I guess.

That feels about right to me considering I feel about halfway back to normal at 40 days. I can surely say I feel so much better then I did at the start. It’s slow but it does get better. And everyday is another battle won. All the stories Ive read on here have given me hope to push through. It’s hard, but don’t let that stop you. I’m not special.

349,w6s4o1,"Needing a new suboxone provider and wondering how long I need to stay off benzos once I know when my appointment is. Please read there’s a lot of information in there. How long do benzos last in your system for a urine test if I’ve been taking them semi daily for about a month?

I need to get a Suboxone prescriber, because I am on opioid maintenance therapy and currently on suboxone  because I do not want to relapse on opiates. 
The reason I take benzos is because I am single and I go on a lot of dates and they really help me be myself when I’m first meeting a girl and I have a fair amount of  success with smashing on the first date on the times I take benzos versus the times I don’t.  

Lately I’ve been hooking up with people more often and I have been taking benzos more regularly. The issue is I am currently looking for a prescriber for Buprenorphine( suboxone ) because the one I was with was treating me like shit. I have my own mental conditions where I have trouble peeing so doing in person drug tests every single week is really really hard for me and causes me a lot of stress.  The place I worked with wasn’t willing to let me do drug tests less often or do blood tests instead of urine so I ended up leaving them since I still had a fair amount of subs left over. 

So I’m now looking for a doc and I’m sure I will need to give them at least 1 clean drug test. I’m not sure when I’ll have an appointment with the doctor who can prescribe me subs but when I do I’ll need to make sure my urine is clean. 

After I know when my appointment is how long should I start to taper / stay off benzos to ensure my piss is clean? (I have a very fast metabolism I’m a skinny guy)

EDIT: Thank you everyone for all the great comments! There were a lot so sorry if I haven't replied to everyone. There seems to be strong opinions on both sides of the argument. What I have decided is to take the middle road - I'm going to only take suboxone the first 2, maybe 3 weeks max, and the smallest amount possible (much less than what my Dr. is recommending), than do a taper for another 2 weeks off of it. I'm hoping this will help get me through my most fragile point of withdrawal, without becoming dependent on yet another thing. I will plan on posting an update in a few weeks (I'm planning to jump from the Kratom June 1st). Thank you for all the words of support!   


Hi friends - I won't get into my whole story but I'm currently taking a pretty high amount of Kratom built up over the past 4 years. I started taking Kratom for anxiety and never had any issues with any other substances. (\*Side note, I'd really prefer not to focus on arguing the merits of kratom, it, IS highly addictive and behaves the same way as other opiates, but I do realize it has helped many people come off worse things\*). I've tried to quit numerous times CT (tapering does not work for me), never made it past Day 16. I can easily get through the physical acutes, especially with some helper meds from my doctor, but it's always the anhedonia and empty feeling from PAWS that does me in, despite being on Celexa for a few years. I've also tried Naltrexone, that helped with cravings but I still couldn't handle the anhedonia that came along with it, especially since I am in a very demanding, creative field where I have to be on my A-game all the time.

Anywho - I have been discussing with my Dr. trying to use Suboxone to help quit this time. I understand how it works, that it is also an opioid that binds to the Mu receptors but she claims it cannot make me high, and will help me feel normal. When I ask her how long I will have to stay on subs, she never really gives a straight answer. My understanding is it's usually a very long term thing? I also see many of the horror stories on here of others in the process of trying to quit subs and that the WD's are much worse than kratom. BC of all this, I am a bit hesitant and afraid of trading one thing for another....it may be the lesser of two evils but it sounds like it will be just one more thing I have to quit in the future, and will not be allowing my brain to heal itself fully. I'd love to hear from you folks - What are your experiences with it? Does it help? How long were you on it, and what did you have to go through to quit suboxone? Were you able to successfully use it for just a very short amount of time? Do you get withdrawal from that and at what dosages/amounts of time? I'd love to hear your stories. My Dr. is pushing it pretty hard and saying it's harmless but anecdotal stories I've seen about it seem to suggest otherwise. Much love fellow quitters!","['CDU', 'PPE', 'MA']",0,1,1,1,0,0

363,ulz40c,"Had anyone had dental implants?. My wife’s teeth are falling apart and she is being somewhat rushed into surgery for dental implants, before there is a plan in place for pain management. 

Has anyone gone through this? She is on 8mg buprenorphine daily. I assume that ideally she would gradually transfer to a short acting opioid pain med over a period of a few weeks, then take an increased dose of the pain med for a week or two post-surgery, then do what it takes to revert back to suboxone without experiencing precipitated withdrawals. 

Does anyone have any experience or advice? My concern is that our doctor will under prescribe, expecting something like tramadol to be effective. 

The dentist doctor said that they do whatever the pain management doctor says when it come to patients on MAT, but I don’t think our doctor has any experience in this area. He is reasonable though and appears to value our opinions so any advice I can pass on would be much appreciated.  

Is is feasible that switching to tramadol to “prevent” withdrawal will work and then allow something like oxycodone to work for a couple of weeks?

364,km2mmp,"Went 7 days w/o taking subs then broke today and took .3 mg. Am I screwed?. So, I think most people on here can probably relate to the bathroom issue suboxone causes. That’s my main reason for wanting to get off of it. I went to a detox on the 14th and went from 4mg at home to none at the end of my stay. Today I ran out of all my comfort meds and, as it’s the holiday, my PCP isn’t in. I couldn’t do it. I was on day 7 and haven’t been able to sleep, concentrate or do much of anything. I had this horrible emptiness emotionally- I couldn’t feel anything. Today, the chills and sweats were in full force. I’m wondering how long it’ll take for .3 mg to be out of my system and how badly this will detract from my progress? Like, will it leave my system faster because it’s such a low amount? I’m not planning on taking any other suboxone in the next week until I can go to the bathroom but I’m extremely disappointed in myself that I broke.

399,bxvf7t,"Been looking for a chart to help estimate detectability of Buprenorphine matabolites in urine sample. Either a chart or anecdotal feedback is appreciated.


Been dosing approximately 2mg per day for about a year. Now, to be honest... maybe about a week ago I took up to 3mg in a day and that could have happened a handful more times in the weeks prior. However, since the first half of this past week, I have kept myself capped at 2mg.


Furthermore, Yesterday I took about 1mg in the the morning and today I took a similar amount. I don't really feel any differently, maybe even less inclined to feel ""sleepy"" but it hasn't been long enough to sense the change in dosage. I have no work this week, in fact no work until Tuesday, so I figured this would be a good time to test the waters. It is my understanding (or mis-understanding) that many people don't ""feel"" different until 2-3 days after dropping their dosage or jumping off from dosages ranging from 2-8mg. 


I mean like, if I took 8mg today, maybe it would take longer for me to feel symptoms if I stopped tomorrow and every day thereafter.  I base this theory on increased levels in the bloods stream.



Anyway, that's a little background on my mindset and current knowledge. 


&nbsp;


**Why have I chosen to ""test the waters"" by dropping from a comfortable and stable dose of 2mg down to 1mg?**

New job, it's looking good. Not officially hired yet but was given the ""congratulations"" by the prospective employer. I'm just a waiting for paperwork and other background checks to clear. What I don't know is IF they will even have me submit for a urine screening or drug test in general. As it stands in NYC right now, a lot of employers no longer test for drugs at all, such as the case is for retailers. A google search shows that a law was passed, but the mayor has not signed it. He hasn't vetoed it either, and it seems that private sector businesses are at least following suit with the legislative winds.


On the other hand, I'm not so sure about the local government and civil service jobs. 


Obviously, police still get tested. That's pretty much expected. Garbage men too, whether we disagree or agree with that... it's at least kinda logical. Presumably anything involving heavy machinery is or will be exempt from the prohibition against testing for marijuana. 


&nbsp;

It has been difficult to determine some kind of gold standard. Like, googling ""what kind of drug test does NYC civil service jobs use"" (use/have/administer?) 


Do they splurge on testing for bupe? Even if they did, maybe it doesn't matter at 2mg. Someone at 2mg per their script told me that their doctor can't even detect it anymore during the urine screenings. So for that person at least, **evidently 2mg results in a result that is below the ng/l cutoff.**

Still, I'm paranoid... so I figure that if my chances of sliding below the cut-off at 2mg are good, they should be better if I drop my dose drastically for a few days. I figure that maybe upon hiring me they'll instruct me to report somewhere for a urine test. Alternately, they'll give me my work schedule and spring it upon me as a surprise during the day or upon arrival. 


In both cases, it's easier for me to prepare for the urine test if I'm specifically instructed to report for or if it happens at the beginning of my first shirt.  If tested, I would use the same ""internal dilution"" method which I use for THC. **This essential means, drinking enough water to piss clear and then eating, taking vitamins and drinking an energy drink to help re-introduce color to the sample.** Yes, color is part of the equation and the other part is creatine/creatinine levels. That's fine, that's why I intend to enlisting the aide of greasy food, protein shakes, and energy drinks. **That method should give me a roughly 4-hour window of clean piss.**


The more important thing might just be to ensure that THC metabolites are below the cut-off. They may not test for Buprenorphine at all. Howver it doesn't hurt to try. Bupe has a long half-life although it doesn't stick around after using for as long as weed. More importantly, **unlike weed, I have been and plan on continuing to take Buprenorphine** for the foreseeable immediate future. This is not to say I don't plan on tapering. Indeed, I've already started the taper but if I was to get hired on monday and find out that there would not be a urine test, or if I was get a urine test next week and pass that test.. I might bring my dose back up to 2mg.


Most likely, once I know I'm out of the woods with the drug test, I would re-stabilize at 1.5-1.75mg. In the mean time I have two main goals:

* Prepare myself to pass a THC urine test through abstaining (it's been a little over a week), and  ""flushing"" -- just drinking fluids daily and exercising on my bicycle.

* Make preparations for ""test day"" by having a plan to prep my body for ""internal dilution"" so that the THC and Bupe metabolites will be below the cut-off. 


The second bullet point cannot and will not be enacted until the day of the test. Like, I can read, prepare... get more info.... but there is no point in waking up every day for week, drinking enough water to piss clear and taking vitamins to bring color back to it. That said, I do plan to do that a couple of times in conjunction with an @home drug test. I have the bupe card/strip coming in the mail tomorrow. So far, I'm just taking urine tests for THC at different parts of the day to see how the results change.

&nbsp;

If it wasn't for the *possibility* that I'd be getting a urine test for this new job, I would not have chosen to drop my dose so drastically in such a short time. I'm just glad/lucky that I don't have work for enough days that I have the option to see how this goes. I want to see, if I can hold out and adjust to the new dose. If I can't then I'd raise the dose by the time I start the new job and especially after I'm out of the woods on testing.

**tl;dr:** New job, possible urine test. Trying to find out if NYC civil service jobs that are not police or garbage men (heavy machinery) are still given drug tests. If so, I'm trying to find out what kind of test (how many panel) and if they test for Buprenorphine as well as how many ng/l is the cut-off might be.



Furthermore, it is not lost upon me that I wouldn't be here asking this question if I had opted to get my Suboxone from a doctor. I've been comfortable with my dosing regiment, although now I am more motivated to ensure that I do not go above my stable 2mg dose under any circumstance. I am also grateful that I have not felt the need or desire to touch heroin or oxy for the past 11 months and that I have two months worth of Suboxone on hand. So basically, it's easier to stop taking any opioid when I know I didn't run out. I'd imagine that I might feel differently right now (placebo effect) if I had simply run-out.",['PPE'],0,0,1,0,0,0

There is a wide variety of alkaloids in the Kratom plant so who knows what all the other shit in there does to your brain? Scary. Like WDing from multiple substances IMO.

Update 2.0: Letting everyone know that I talked to the doctor from quick.md and everything worked out. Tomorrow I will pick up the prescription and start the induction phase.
 
Update 3.0: Everything worked out perfectly with the at home induction. Still adjusting the right dose but more than likely stay on a low dose. I want to say that if anyone is struggling with opioid use disorder and want to try suboxone for treatment then give quick.md a try if you don't want to pay the high prices of a clinic and don't want to drive anywhere to get help. The prices for treatment are reasonable and I haven't had any problems with the cvs pharmacy that I went to. Your miles may vary though but my experience so far has been a breeze. Doctor was nice too.

Pre-Treatment: 
Needing desperate help in finding out about other people's experiences with telehealth for getting on suboxone. Which one did you use and prices. I had planned on using quick.md the other day but when I went to make the appointment there was only 1 doctor available for my area, 1 !!! And to make matters worse my bank card didn't go through because the deposited check has to take 24 hours. But today my funds are available but that one doctor now only has a opening for June 24th. Which is too long of a wait for me. 
So does anyone on here know of and has experience with telehealth suboxone treatment and which company, pricing and procedures. I need to know for the State of Missouri. I only found so far using google quick.md, recoverydelivered, brighthearthealth, e-psychiatry. 
And the reason if anyone wants to know is because I've been an addict since I was 12 and now 40 years old. Got into pain killers about 2010 and lasted a year, heavy use. Fast forward to 2016 and started kratom all the way to present day but also been using pain killers again for about 6 months. I've tried to quit about 8 or 9 times so far and was semi successful twice but only made it to the 53 day mark and then 31 day mark give or take a few days as the paws is too unbearable. I'm sick of living like this and would like to give suboxone or buprenophine a shot. It seems alot of people have success with it as long as they stay on it.

403,tn4frs,"I hate my addiction doctor ughh (also question about sublocade). I’ve been on 8 mg of Suboxone a day for months. It doesn’t help my cravings at all. I’m doing fine but I just feel like at any point I’m going to snap and become an alcoholic or turn to something else to change my brain. I finally told my doctor about how I was feeling even tho I’ve described these cravings to her in one of our first meetings after starting suboxone. Unfortunately this time she cornered me and said “ we need to increase your level of care if you want to stay on this medicine and work with us because of what you’re experiencing” she said I would either have to come in every week (I normally see her evedy 2-3 weeks and do urine testing, or I would have to switch to sublocade because somehow she thinks it would help my cravings more than suboxone, which makes no sense to me. My personal plan is to taper down from 8mg to a low dose that I actually feel. (I always see people say they’re cravings are way better on doses .25-1mg because of the norbupenorphine) I just want to know does sublocade help more than suboxone? Do you feel something off of it more than the strips? I imagine it would be harder because you lose the ability to take something everyday which for an addict is helpful and makes us feel better even if it’s just placebo to take something everyday, then to just get a shot 1x a month. 

Let me know what you guys think. I’m thinking about switching doctors. 

TL:DR my doc said I had to increase my level of care because I expressed I was having cravings to her and she said I either HAD TO see her once a week instead of once every 2-3 weeks, or switch to the sublocade shot (because it supposedly helps with cravings more) what do you guys think?","['MA', 'PPE', 'TP']",0,1,1,0,1,0

I’ve been in this life for about 10 years starting with oxy and ultimately leading to suboxone dependency. 
For the past 5 years, subs have helped me turn my life around and begin rebuilding a lot of the damage I had done. For that, I am forever grateful.

But I can’t help but feel that my journey to recovery will not be complete until I am no longer dependent on any substance.

I still smoke weed every day like I’ve been doing since I was 14 and I’ll have a drink a couple times a year.

I’ve been on suboxone for the majority of the last 3 years as well and it’s literally been a lifesaver. I wouldn’t be here right now without it. Eventually I’ll get off of it but life was so bleak a few years ago that i wouldn’t take any chances going back to living that way, and suboxone has made that possible. Ideally I’d like to be off of it by this time next year but we’ll see. I’m not in a huge rush to get off of it but I’m finally feeling some distance from my time using and things don’t feel as fresh.

As for the appointment, it was nice and easy. Didn't even take a UA actually and  now I have refills as apposed to having to see the doctor every time. That will be nice, I am just hoping that I am able to keep playing the responsible game and if not I can always let the doctor know I would prefer to have an appointment to check in. I don't think that type of honesty would hurt at all

It cost $99 for the initial appointment, of course i had fears playing out in my head like, what if this is a scam, what if i lose my money...yada yada yada...But i decided FUCK IT, i want and need the help, whats the worst that can happen...I have been spending SO MUCH MONEY on the OxyCodone 30's i been doing so this $99 aint shit compared to what i been blowing on my addiction! So i made the appointment, and withing 24 hours i was speaking to a doctor VIA video appointment! I was so amazed at how quick, and EASY it was...She was non-judgemental....She was helpful, she gave me hope! I couldn't believe it! Not only did she Prescribe me Suboxone but she also gave me other meds to help with the initial withdrawal before taking the strips and to help me sleep! I was literally IN TEARS...i never imagined that i could find help so easily and quickly, and to make things better...I was offered free help thru their program, which is a counseling type of thing that is online, where you basically complete these, modules, i believe she called them where you are actually given $5 dollar gift certificates for each and every module you complete. There were NO HIDDEN FEES...NOTHING...I simply paid the $99 for the appointment, and at the pharmacy every single medication was FREE due to the fact i have IEHP i live in california so i have Medi-Cal, and they covered Everything. (Even the Suboxone)! SO IF YOUR LIKE ME, and you WANT THE HELP, and you need it ASAP...NO hassle, No hidden fees, NO JUDGEMENT....I recommend QUICKMD....I had an appointment with the doctor SUSAN KOO...She was an angel...And a true blessing! She was understanding, sympathetic, kind, helpful and all around AMAZING! If you have any questions, feel free to ask and i will try and respond as quickly as possible!

454,juk1gv,"To Jump, or not to Jump.... THAT.. is the question... =)

This is almost silly, but I’m sure you guys get it. 
I’m very knowledgeable about opioids, the addiction, and the withdrawal. I’ve been around here from time to time giving others advice on getting clean...

The thing is, when it comes down to giving myself the advice, it just feels like a conflict of interest. 
I had 5 years clean from the big H, but i herniated a disk and relapsed. The pain was terrible, I couldn’t seem to get relief from doctors, their cortisone shots, and the opioid crisis made them look at me and treat me awfully. 

I’ve been on 16mg of suboxone now for over a year? I’ve lost track, and I’m starting to really wish to be off it, but that’s complicated. I worry my back pain is there waiting for me. Sometimes it still rears up, and quite possibly I’m not having to feel it because I take subs. I also still get this crazy wtf-pain in my left testicle. Doctors and urologists dismissed me, thought I was drug seeking even when I flat out said, “I DONT WANT ANYTHING. I WANT IT FIXED!” and told me it’s ‘vericocele’ and I’m going to have to deal with it. “It doesn’t usually hurt” they say as they look at my swollen junk. Thanks, opioid epidemic. Thanks ridiculous hysterical urologist. Can you believe I turned down drugs from this guy, literally asked him to cut off my ball, and he was a dick to me? 

There is the benefit of having that constant safety net. I see a counselor, I have a dying/dead 8 year relationship, but I am starting to feel like I’m not myself. At first it was nice having that little boost, and those filled receptors. I still get it sometimes. It was nice having my more negative moods and emotional tendencies blunted, but I’m starting to realize I may just feel all around flat; always in neutral.

I used to be against MAT until I relapsed, and needed it to keep my life together. I had gained too much ground to keep failing at cold turkey. When I finally committed myself to it I felt converted. In a way I still do think it’s probably the safest bet, but I also think this growing uncertainty will do just that.. continue to grow.

I am having a hard time getting really zealous about committing to going down though. I’m scared of going back to the state I was in when I was trying to get clean before this; taking subs, trying to stop, and then doing both subs and heroin. Things get crazy when you’re in that stage. It’s a ...transition.

Would anyone mind sharing their motivations and experience if they’ve been through something similar? I am sort of feeling like if I have to take anything for the back pain I am capable of having from this herniated disk issue, then I’d prefer that it’s this. I tried gabapentin and all that type of stuff. For stupid addict reasons and just the way it affected me... I much prefer opioids. They work. I don’t have seizures if I run out, I just feel like hell.

Should I just count my blessings and not get too deep thinking about it? I think I’m capable of doing that. Sometimes I have these stupid thoughts like, what if something terrible happens and I suddenly can’t get my medicine, what if the apocalypse happens... I can get this done now and be good! Really, stupid, catastrophic what-ifs.. I don’t know if that’s unique to me. Sometimes like I mentioned I feel like I’m not myself anymore. Like I’m just...coasting through life... the absence of overly negative thoughts and feelings that come with addiction really has a way of making me feel like a zombie.

455,c1szt2,"Question / Experience. Okay.. so bear with me here. I'm a mobile user and my initial post was confusingly worded.. massively edited for clarity

I'm a long time heavy user now, about a decade. I finally got clean about a year ago just to fall back into it. However I was driving back and forth to New Orleans (a multiple hour drive) to get my dope. So sometimes I would run out and have to go to work with no dope while sick. So after that happened once I said fuck that and got some subs. 

So waking up one morning, after having been bingeing on dope and finally running out- I wouldn't be feeling terrible just yet, just mildly dope sick, I made a SHOT out of a piece of a strip, about an eighth to a quarter. I mixed it up and shot it (IV) and about a minute later I got the precipitated withdrawals. However that went away within 5 to 10 minutes after. 

I would continue this practice only when I had run out of drugs and needed to be held over. Doing a sub shot when I was beginning to feel sick (not full blown sick, mind you, at all) and experiencing the same thing. A minute after a small IV shot I would get TERRIBLY sick, gagging, sweating, shaking, the works... But I would just wait it out and ten minutes later I would be fine for about 24 hours. 

Is this common? Have any of you done this?

My point is that most people say you have to wait until you're in complete WD before taking subs or else you risk the Precipitated WD's- (which EVERY person I know says lasts for hours) And especially because I'm shooting the subs which activate the Precipitated WD's. But why does it only last a few minutes for me? Then I'm fine. It doesn't seem like much of a deterrent to people who wanna shoot it. I'm asking because I can't find this info anywhere else online. 

Anyways, slightly unrelated note:

I'm currently on methdaone (worked my way down to only 18mgs a day now!) And I am planning to keep coming down until I'm on 2mg. Then I want to switch to hopefully tabs or percs for a week then come off of those. Possibly with extremely small doses of suboxone as I've done that before to skip withdrawal after a heroin taper.

477,pq5cyj,"Suboxone has turned into a money making machine for clinics. I've been off of Heroin for almost 9 years now. I couldn't stay clean, and was in and out of treatment. So I got on suboxone when I was 19. 

My first doctor was this old man who had his patient's come to his house. He charged $25 a visit, and I saw him once a month. He truly cared about me staying clean. However, after about two years of seeing him he retired. So he referred me to a local doctor he knew at a clinic. 

My second doctor was an older man too, and truly cared about my sobriety. The whole clinic did. They were all so nice and caring. I stayed with him for over 6 years. The last several I saw him once every 3 months and paid $100 for each appointment. So $100 every three months. He also put me on subutex so it was cheaper. I never failed a drug test and was his longest patient. He asked me to speak at a convention, but then covid hit. 

Earlier this year I was notified that he was also retiring. It was sad, but I understood. He gave me his personal email and told me to keep in touch. 

I was referred to this other clinic, and a couple of months ago started going. Right away I knew it was different. The staff was rude, and I didn't even see a doctor. Now they are letting PAs prescribe suboxone. They made me see them 4 times the first month despite me being clean for 8 years. And then every three weeks. Each visit costs $250. So my balance is already over $1000 in two months. I paid $400 a year at my other clinic. On top of that they are making me switch back to suboxone, which also costs more. 

I can't afford this. Today they said if I didn't pay in full by next visit I would be discharged. I feel like they are all about $$$. They couldn't care less about people's sobriety. They make me feel like I'm a piece of garbage. I haven't felt this way since I was using.

When I first saw the doctor, I explained that I'd been buying subs and once zubsolv off the street for a bit. He gave me the choice between the two, and I chose zubsolv because I remember it tasted better and if I wanted to switch to subs, I could.

Now, my PA won't switch me back to Suboxone even though I told her the Zubsolv doesn't seem to work for anything besides keeping my withdrawals at bay -- I was an addict because I had horrible chronic back pain, and went on subs because it helped that too-- but the zubsolv doesn't help the pain at all. She told me there's ""no medical reason"" to switch me.

Secondly, I had always kept a sub strip in my mouth for 5-10 minutes before swallowing so I did pretty much the same with zubsolv. The PA told me I was ""doing it wrong"", that subs need to stay for 30 minutes and zubs for 20. Subs are fairly easy to keep in my mouth longer, as I put it on the inside of my cheek.

490,fqr0d2,"First Post - Day 4 off of Subs!. Hi all! You may have seen some of my comments over the past few months talking about how I was going to taper & get off of suboxone by the summer. Well here I finally am!

I started at 8MG but stupidly went up to 16MG, so I had to taper down from there. 16 back down to 8 took way longer than needed, I think I was overly cautious. Once I was down to 8 again I dropped what I could each week (usually a MG, then I cut from 4 to 2 quickly). Once I got under 2MG I usually cut about .25 each week. Excluding the overly long drop from 16 to 8, it really only took about 4-6 months tops. 

Given the current circumstances, I was able to finally jump from .5MG now that I don’t have to worry about work for a little while. Ideally I was hoping to jump from .25 or lower, but the opportunity finally presented itself this week to jump without having to worry about ANY other obligations. 

The past few days have been ok. Restless legs, low motivation/laying around, stomach issues ofc and some sleep disturbances, but nothing compared to heroin withdrawal. Sex drive comes back all at once, too, in a major way. But it’s been entirely manageable with comfort meds like clonidine, trazodone and gabapentin. Day/Night 3 of sleeping was the worst because my stomach hurt and I tossed and turned more than usual, but I slept like a baby last night. 

I know it doesn’t sound that bad, but I still don’t know if I’d be up to working during this time. The low motivation is the toughest part. However, I definitely am getting some energy back today already. I’ll keep you all posted! Happy to answer any questions 😊","['TP', 'PPE']",0,0,1,0,1,0

I see an NP for MAT. I receive Vivitrol injections once a month to help curb alcohol cravings, in addition to other forms of MAT for alcohol use disorder. I also understand that Vivitrol is commonly used for *opioid use disorder*, but fortunately I don't have that. The last time I used opioids was when I got my wisdom teeth out like 5 years ago, and I used them for recreation a few times as a teenager.

This brings me to today, when I hopped on my online patient portal. I noticed that in my medical history, among my other diagnoses, it said ""Opioid Use Disorder - In Remission"". My NP recorded this as a diagnosis on the last date of my Vivitrol injection.

I know this is a mistake - when I became a new patient we went over my history and I was honest. I also get drug tested about 2x/month and they've all been negative for any drug. I figured that my doctor probably just accidentally selected ""Opioid Use Disorder"" when recording that I got a Vivitrol shot because most people get one for that.

But then under notes it said that she prescribed me Suboxone, along with instructions for taking it. I called my pharmacy and they said they never got it, but they do have a Narcan prescription for me. I don't know why she would even prescribe me subs anyways since I'm on Vivitrol.

**How would a diagnosis for opioid use disorder plus a recorded subs prescription affect my chances of ever being prescribed opioids in the future?** I've never once asked a doctor to prescribe me opioids, I'm more thinking like, what if I break my leg or develop some sort of chronic pain? I assume I would be able to explain taking Vivitrol for alcohol, but certainly not that my doctor fucked up a diagnosis. As I'm sure many of you know, addicts aren't considered the most trustworthy people by doctors - try getting a prescription for your crippling anxiety when you've been diagnosed with AUD.

I guess the upside of this is that I have a Narcan prescription now, which is always great to keep around. I'm going to call my doctor when they open tomorrow to see if she can fix this. Any info or personal experience is appreciated.

ETA: I've been thinking about this all day and it just hit me how dangerous this could be if the pharmacy had actually received the prescription from my NP. What if I wasn't knowledgeable about this interaction, picked up the subs when they were filled, and tried to get high on them? Being on Vivitrol, that could have killed me. And before you say that no one could be that stupid, I guarantee you they can. I've gotten a Vivitrol injection from many different providers and they don't always tell you all the risks or give you the medical alert bracelet/info sheet that they're supposed to.

My issue is, some day’s I am so lethargic that I find it difficult to leave my bed.  It’s absolutely killing my social life and greatly affecting my relationship. I’m lucky enough that my husband is understanding but I’m sure his patience is wearing thin. However, some days I feel like a damn superhero! I get so many things done and I’m super talkative and excited; my husband’s even noticed and will say something like “I don’t think you’ve sat down all day.” 

I have not talked too extensively with my psychiatrist about this  because I don’t know if this is perhaps just a side effect of the medication itself and although she’s a really great, helpful and kind doctor, I find myself afraid to talk to her about this. I told her about how I’d felt super lethargic, unable to focus and/or complete almost any task and she just said, “I’ll double your Wellbutrin.” And sent me out the door. 

My question to you all is: have you felt this way? Do you know if is this common with long-term Suboxone use? If you’ve felt this way before and have figured out a way around it, what did you do differently? Do you prefer to take your dosage all at one time or do you split it up throughout the day?

510,sc06kc,"Workit Health telemedicine experience. So I had been using Bupe.me for the last few months since getting on sub from fent and yesterday I got a Facebook ad for Workit Health and I hadn’t heard of them so I looked into it. Here’s my experience..

I downloaded the app and filled in my information. Including my insurance info. It was really quick and easy. Once creating the account it immediately took me to choosing an appointment time for induction appointment. This was 3 pm yesterday and had appointments available for as early as 730 am the next day(today). I chose 830 am. I was never prompted to pay which I though was weird so I messaged the support thing and asked about if I would get script same day and about paying. Got an auto response that support would be open Monday morning at 8am. The app if very well designed. There’s a chat tab at the bottom and has 3 different chat logs already there to choose from for either Admin, counselor or provider. Literally at 8:02 am this morning I had a response. Very impressed by that. So onto the actual appointment..

My NP, Jessica, I was very impressed with. Could tell she was actually engaged and cared. Told me they work from the harm reduction approach. Took into account everything I brought up and was very intelligent. When we got on the subject of my dose I told her what I had been taking for the last few months and that it seemed to be holding me but I have a few days a week where I’d get intense cravings but that I really didn’t want to go up in dose because my ultimate goal is eventually complete abstinence. So what she said was I’m going to write you your normal 16mg a day with some extra strips. If you have a day where you need to take an extra half due to cravings you can do so. Otherwise let’s stick to 16mg. It’s the first time I’ve ever had a sub doctor think outside the box like that that wasn’t completely upping the dose without a second thought. I know it sounds so simple but it also impressed me. She literally sent the prescription over to my pharmacy while I was on the video call with her and I got the auto text from Walgreens that they had received while still on the chat with her. We talked for a good minute and I definitely enjoyed the experience. She told me “We are treating you with suboxone for opiate use disorder. If you smoke weed or do some other drug we are not going to cut you off for that. We don’t encourage it but if we can help get someone stable on the opiate part of things then that’s a potential life saved.” I don’t use any other drugs but I definitely agree with the harm reduction approach. 

I never was charged anything. My insurance covered the whole visit. Most insurance plans now have little or no copay for virtual outpatient mental health stuff. This service includes your own counselor/therapist that you can talk to any time. I asked her what the cash price is for people without insurance and it’s 300$ a month which isn’t the cheapest option. You get what you pay for though with how well everything is managed and how quick response time is. There’s no worrying if the script will be there or not because she sends it while on the video call with you every month. 

Sorry for the wall of text but I wanted to share my positive experience. Especially for people with insurance that hasn’t been able to utilize it since most other services don’t accept it. They’re not in all states right now but she said by the middle of this year they plan to be in all 50 states.",['AL'],1,0,0,0,0,0

I even got down to 8mgs pretty easily at one point, against my doctor's advice, and I felt a lot better, but then I made the stupid decision to go back up to what the doctor wanted me on. Ugh. 

I've gotten clean cold turkey twice. Once in 2013 from around 300mgs of oxycodone a day, and I did it the old fashioned way... In jail. The next time, two years ago, I went cold turkey from H for the first 6 or 7 days until a family member convinced me to get prescribed Suboxone. Both times it was miserable, but short lived. The problem is I've never gotten off subs before, and from what I understand the half life is much longer, therefore the withdrawal stage is much longer. 

I've been doing the slow taper, but I'm sooo over it. How bad would bad be if I just buckled down and went off cold? I'm sure it would be rough, but would it be worth having my life back finally? I just don't realistically know what I'm looking at here because I've never experienced it. I've gone as long as 3 or 4 days between doses multiple times, which wasn't too bad, but that's the extent of my experience. 

I've even wondered if theoretically, if I went back on a small dose of oxycodone for 30 days or so, in a supervised environment of course, if I could then get off the oxy much quicker and easier than the subs. But, I don't even know if it works that way or not. I'm just trying to think of anything that might work.

Interested in taper support, I’ve been sucked into the world of daily suboxone after an inconsistent oxycodone habit that was originally upwards of 150mg/day; for over 2 years, aside from a few months I tried to stop, I’ve been temporarily stopping my suboxone use to go on 200-240mg/day oxycodone binges before transitioning back on to suboxone, settling somewhere in the 2-3mg mark before the next binge came around. I finally got the guts to stop and after my last week-long full agonist binge, having been off of suboxone for about 7 days and purely on oxycodone, I transitioned into a quick taper as below:

Medications: Clonazepam, Clonidine, Loperamide

Day 1: 11mg suboxone, 14mg loperamide, 0.3mg clonidine, 2mg clonazepam nightcap (very anxious, symptomatic day)

Day 2: 6mg suboxone split into 3 2mg doses, 8mg loperamide, 0.2mg clonidine, 2mg clonazepam nightcap

Day 3: 4mg suboxone split into 2 2mg doses, 4mg loperamide, 0.2mg clonidine, 2mg clonazepam nightcap 

Day 4: 3mg suboxone split into 2 1.5mg doses, 0.2mg clonidine, 2mg clonazepam nightcap 

Day 5: 2.6mg suboxone split into 2 1.3mg doses, 0.2mg clonidine, 2mg clonazepam nightcap

Day 6: 1.75 mg suboxone split into a 1mg am and 0.75mg PM dose, 0.2mg clonidine, 2mg clonazepam nightcap 

Day 7: 1.3mg suboxone single AM dose, 0.1mg clonidine, 2mg clonazepam nightcap

Hi there, I have been on subs for three years now. A friend recently switched to methadone and gave me a bottle to try out. I can’t really tell the difference at the dosage I was taking (10mg) daily. Anyways the bottle is almost out and I need to start figuring how to switch back to the subs I have a script for.

Any tips? I have tried to put myself in withdrawal to see what it’s like and I couldn’t make it past 12 hours...

Is 12 hours too soon to switch back to Subs?

I also have Kratom which I haven’t used in awhile maybe that will help?

I guess my two questions are:
1) how long after last dose of methadone should I take a sub?
2) what dose should I start with? I have been on 2mg subs for months before this. Should I start with 1mg and work up from there? Or start with a higher dose of day 4mg or 8mg?

521,ioxm8o,"Snorting Subs Question/Experience. So I know this has already been answered, yes you can snort suboxone, but that's not my question. Let me just say that I am not prescribed it and am not an addict, I simply just wanted to experience the recreational aspect of subs, as i dont want to try the actual drug, with subs being used to basically ween the user off, as far as i know. I used to snort Percocet 10mg pills and was spending close to 400 a month on them, but then just stopped one day, no withdrawal or anything. Recently I snorted about 25 Vicodens over the course of 5 days, they made me more tired and eventually once they wore off I got really nauseous and didn't wanna move, but I feel fine after I sleep. 

So anyway, I've done subs once, like 6 months ago. I was told by my friend that they are much stronger than percocet, and that a little piece crushed up should be good for me. So when I got home, I took a knife and cut off not even a quarter of the pill, probably idk, 1/12th or something, like the size of a grain of rice, crushed it up, and railed it. I don't remember a lot from the high but the weird part I am here to question is, I went to lay down as I was tired. However, soon after I kinda fell asleep but wasn't actually sleeping? I specifically remember my eyes being half open and me being aware I was awake, but also in a position like I was sleeping and I didn't move for like 3 hours. 

I was wondering if this is a bad effect or maybe I did too much at once?

526,kl5ts6,"Espranor (Buprenorphine only) advice?. Hey folks.

I have posted a couple times on here and always got very good help.

I started off opiate issues with Kratom. I was oblivious to the fact that this powder was such a powerful DRUG. I had read it was a great anxiety relief supplement. I had tried ashwagandha/Beta Blockers etc and never felt relief. I mind reading anxiety and Kratom and never actually looked into how Kratom even worked. I bought some and mind i just felt that uplifting glow. Anxiety was down. Just felt a nice mood lift.

This was 3 years ago and this green sludge has destroyed my life. I only take it now for the withdrawals. I done one withdrawal from Kratom and if anyone says it's mild then i feel the complete opposite. I was ill for weeks. Couldn't work that first week. Felt like a flu tbh. I cracked and ended up back on it.

Fast forward to now and i read how a detox of opiates works. I managed to buy buprenorphine (Espranor). So i swapped from Kratom to Buprenorphine and i felt 10x better. I could dose once a day and not think about it again. Kratom i was doing 3-4 times a day. With me buying buprenorphine i was restricted to access and eventually couldn't get a hold of it. I wanted to see if i could handle the withdrawals and it was brutal also i can't deny it. I managed about 5 days and now back to the green sludge 👎

What i have noticed is.. With buprenorphine only i actually feel healthy. With Kratom i wake up EVERY morning in sweats and running nose and just feel like garbage until i dose. I never had this once on buprenorphine. I feel like the Kratom is just destroying my body/brain. I generally just feel unwell all the time on Kratom. I never feel good.

I have reached out to a drug addiction place and i am slowly getting into their system. I would have been much further in but in a previous post i had mentioned a staff member went and told my family member i had reffered myself. I panicked and denied it and never went back. I eventually relaxed and this time i have a support worker alongside me. I went through a different path this time and told her what happened and she was furious and has got me back into the drug addictions clinic with zero disclosure.

I just want to finally put away this Kratom FOREVER. I know buprenorphine is just moving one to the other but atleast i am monitored and taking a prescribed drug. I feel healthy on buprenorphine and actually like myself. Happy and upbeat. Not an anxious mess.

Has anyone else went along this path and says it has 100% been worth it? I know it will be for me personally. I spend a lot of money on Kratom also and it's just a nasty drug. I wish people could see the true side of it. I hate it with a passion.

Also to ask. How long would i be on buprenorphine before being told to taper? I have a fear that their gonna prescribe it very short term and i end up back on Kratom. Just me being paranoid i reckon. If you have a story of your journey that would be great.

Right now I’m on 105mg of methadone and need to switch to Suboxone ASAP… more because I want to than need to… methadone has caused me to go from 125lbs to 215lbs, I gained 60lbs in the first month of methadone alone… I used to use suboxone, I did for a two year period on 8mg and it was great, no weight issues or any issues at all. Now with methadone I’m constantly sweating, fatigued, almost diabetic, my liver is getting fucked… idk how much is the medicine and how much is me but I know I wasn’t this bad on suboxone AT ALL. And I’m looking for options to switch. 

First way is to stop the methadone and wait some days (ten?) to induce in sub but this way is horrifically painful

Second is tapering to 30mg and switching by waiting 3 days instead. But even going down 4mg has me suffering on methadone. That never happened to me while tapering sub

Third way I’ve considered is something called the “azar method” and another one called the “Stanciu method” which involve using medical grade fentanyl as a bridge to Suboxone. Basically stopping methadone, starting fent, staying on it for some time then a normal suboxone induction is done.

Fourth way is doing the above but by myself with illicit opiates (hoping it isn’t street fent because it won’t work) since it’s so hard to find any doctor willing to help me with that in the US

IDK what do you guys think?… I’m really lost and depresssed, I can’t take much more of this…

544,rk6ygw,"Stabilizing on low dose. Hi Everyone,

I began taking suboxone again about a month ago at 1mg as I often get really bad side effects on this medication including feeling dead inside, not caring about anything, cranky, don't want to talk to people, have no passion or desire for anything while on suboxone.

I started on a low dose to avoid these side effects as experienced on higher doses in the past as much as possible and I feel pretty stabilized at 1mg but I am still feeling many of these side effects at a reduced level.

I have read alot of feedback of people having success at 0.5mg and it almost functioning as a antidepressant for them att that amount. 

I am basically trying to get to that point and have been not taking it for a few days then trying 0.5mg for a few days to slowly get my tolerance down and adjusted but I have been getting alot more anxiety at 0.5mg and feel it kinda seems to somewhat wear off throughout the day (I don't go into any physical withdrawals just feel sketchy mentally).

I am just wondering if anyone has any insights into how long it should take to stabilize at 0.5mg or if that's even possible?

I want to believe you can stabilize at 0 5mg as some people have posted alot of success at this very low dose...

 but I also read people who say you'll never stabilize at that low of a dose which is rather discouraging and I am just looking for some hope that it can be done and work well. 

I just really can't tolerate the side effects of this medication and trying to do everything I can to avoid the sides as I am already stable on a very low dose.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.","['PPE', 'MA']",0,1,1,0,0,0

Hey all, I've been on suboxone/subutex(due to current pregnancy) for about a year now, and clean from all drugs since I've been on this medication. It has helped me stay clean and not crave for so long, it really has helped me with my addiction. The down side of it though, is I suffer from OIC very badly and I usually become fecally impacted. The pregnancy hasn't helped at all, but it gets unbearable. 


I'm currently fecally impacted, and it's the second time this month, about 5th time this year. I'm in a lot of pain, and im about to take an Epson salt bath and attempt an enema. It's gotten to the point if I eat, I throw up so I haven't eaten since yesterday and have been relying on nutritional shakes. Enemas have been my go to for fecal impaction and they usually work, so I'm very hopeful this works for me this time. However, kinda concerned that this may be a way bigger blockage, and I may have to go to the ER if the enema doesn't work. Kinda concerned I'll be in a way more painful situation if I can't clear this blockage. Anyway, I was wondering, does this ever happen to anyone else? When it gets like this for me, I become very hopeless and depressed because of the pain and the inability for me to do something that should be a natural process. 

How do you guys deal with OIC? Thanks for taking your time to read this.

UPDATE 1: just got out of my magnesium salts bath, smoking a cig for anxiety and unable to pee due to the blockage, about to get this enema done

UPDATE 2: did the enema, got 7 hard masses out, quite small, I'm sure there's more to come.

My name is Brian, and I am a Community Outreach Liaison for Center for Community Alternatives, or CCA. CCA’s mission is to reduce reliance on incarceration and promote restorative justice in accordance with civil and human rights. 

You can read more about CCA here: [http://communityalternatives.org/](http://communityalternatives.org/) 

CCA’s Crossroads to Recovery program has been around for years, but now we are finally equipped to provide MAT for individuals with substance use disorders. Right now, our doctor is meeting with folks via telehealth and in-person to provide Suboxone.

While our main office is in Brooklyn – residents from all over NYC and the surrounding areas are eligible for our services. In fact, we have recently done intakes for individuals who live in Yonkers and Staten Island. Most of the programming can happen virtually through telehealth – or in-person if you prefer. Immigration status is not an issue, and we can work with folks who do not currently have insurance and help them obtain insurance. 

We are also fast-tracking participants; individuals referred to me can complete their intake ASAP and meet with the doctor within the next day or two.

A little bit more context:

She used heroin for probably 4-5 years. Went to rehab and got clean, then had a relapse a year or two later and went back to rehab. She tells me she has been completely clean (from heroin) since. This all predates me, so I'm a little fuzzy on the exact lengths of time. 

She's also told me that she has done mushrooms/weed/cocaine/and various other party drugs in the past, but never had much of a problem with them. IE would do them at parties, but never developed any sort of addiction.

Also, (and I'm not sure if this is relevant or not) about 2 years ago she spent some time in the hospital for fungal meningitis, and about 4 months ago she had to go back to the hospital because she had developed hydrocephalus as a result of the meningitis she had years before. She was prescribed diamox, which she takes daily and seems to at least alleviate her headaches enough for her to function pretty normally throughout the day.

Recently, I'm concerned that she is abusing suboxone. I found out that she has been having a friend send her pills for the past few months (at least) and has been taking them behind my back. When I confronted her, she of course lied at first but then admitted to it and said she only takes it because it helps with her headaches when they get too bad, and doesn't get a prescription for it because it's too expensive. I also have reason to believe that she is shooting it and not taking it as a pill. I've noticed new marks on her arms appear and I overheard her mom upset with her for finding a syringe. I haven't asked her about that yet. Also, in the past couple months she has had a couple episodes of really heavy, uncontrolled shaking and her being extremely cold, and then having what appears to be a fever afterwards. She's told me the doctors don't have an explanation for what it's happening and that it's just a result of her hydrocephalus, but I feel like it has something to do with her being on subutex now because it didn't start happening until she started taking that.

&#x200B;

I know this is a lot, but if you're still with me I have a couple questions:

1. Is it possible to shoot subutex, if so, how does she do it? (sorry I'm new to all of this) What are the associated dangers?
2. Is it possible that she could be using subutex for headaches like she says, or is it more likely she using it because she is feeling the urge to use heroin again?
3. What is the right thing for me to do? I know me getting mad at her and trying to take them away from her is only going to drive her to be more secretive, but I'm not sure how to handle this in a way that would make her want to be more honest with me and want to quit all of this. 

Any advice or words of wisdom are greatly appreciated.

I’m so tired of living this way and putting my kids into this too, even if they don’t know it yet. Going on suboxone is not my first choice. I’m not addicted to heroin or fentanyl, but actually, Kratom. I was embarrassed to post this but i figured, what the hell. I know Kratom is supposed to be weaker and easier to get off of, but i had a horrible time. I didn’t feel normal for months and months, and just got so sick of feeling horrible and trying to be a mom that i relapsed. I’ve also spent a ton of money on it. I did the math and realized i would be saving a ton of money being on suboxone. I think with Kratom being legal, it is really hard for me to control myself. I’ve tried and failed numerous times, but being able to buy it makes it worse. I know the risks of subs, i just don’t see another option right now. I would rather a doctor monitor everything and not freak out every morning wondering where I’ll get money to go buy more Kratom.

593,c2iecj,"Suboxone and bilateral anterior total hip replacement​. I have debated writing something here to get thoughts and advice for some time. I'm about 8 days out from having bilateral hip replacement surgery so I thought this was a good time.

I've been on subs for nearly 10 years. In that 10 years, I've had one other surgery where I took Subutex that I literally found, by some miracle, in my house about a week before the surgery.

This time though, that isn't going to happen.

I've spoken to the surgeon and my Suboxone doctor about this upcoming surgery and I've been told by my Suboxone doctor to stop taking subs 24 hours before surgery for the pain meds to work. I'm not sure I can do that first of all, but let's say I do, is that long enough for the pain meds to work from your experiences?

I've had the conversation about Subutex with the sub Dr several times. He is not willing to prescribe that or any other opiate ahead of time. I'm also not sure that the surgeon understands tolerance, though I don't get the feeling he's judging me for being a junky for nearly two decades, at least.

I also wondered if anyone had any experience similar to mine where they did not go back on Suboxone? If I had known 10 years ago what I know now about getting off this stuff, I never would have stayed on it like I have.

I did nearly 20 years of heroin addiction on and off so I wasn't a light user. I know my initial Suboxone Dr's point of view was that I would never get off of it because he felt it was too risky for me. At this point in my life, I don't feel that way. I'm fairly certain my head is in the best place it's ever been and relapse/using isn't ever even a fleeting thought any longer. I'm not stupid enough to think it can't come back though, especially when I have to do things like take pain pills to recover from a major surgery. I dunno. Thoughts and advice welcome.

She is small and always med sensitive so after taking 3 pills for the first dose, she slept almost the whole day.

1) Does anyone have experience with Lucemyra and would it be ok to just do 1 pill x 3-4 doses tomorrow to avoid her sleeping the whole day? And then taper from that level?


2) I am not sure of why there is a requirement for her to need 7-10 days to start vivitrol if she was on such a low dose? I guess if it was lime a jump from 4 mg that makes sense but wouldn't .125mg be pretty negligible in a few days?

I updated about days 1 and 2 already. 

Days 3-6 were possibly a little harder,  at times, but still totally bearable. I was able to work, go see fireworks, go to a wedding (and even dance!) and work on the house we're demo-ing/rebuilding. Keep in mind I was never someone who was willing to go do anything when I was dopesick. I was never a ""push through it, distract yourself, get your mind off it"" sick person. I was a lay in bed and moan and groan and focus on every symptom miserably type of sick person.   So I think that speaks to the fact that going out every day and doing life means the kick has not been bad at all.  I'd have moments of dragging ass and feeling heavy, some random bouts of sneezing which triggers chills/hot flashes/running nose/watery eyes but it would generally pass. At no point did I ever consider calling my doctor to get my last two subs back. 

I slept great the first two nights. The last few, I've had some squirming restlessness when trying to fall asleep, got some anxiety each time that I was about to be in for a bad night, but still have fallen asleep within 30 minutes and then slept through the night. 

Part of my motivation to get off subs is to find my baseline in order to pursue the cause of my brain fog, fatigue, sleep issues (never wake up feeling rested), depersonalization/derealization. These things I had before subs, before heroin, and they are still persisting now (i thought they seemed a bit better on day 1 and 2 but nah). But all that is just a crappiness I've just always felt (and now finally have a clean slate in order to try to find out why!)

Honestly, I'd been feeling generally shitty after going down to 0.125mg in April by cutting out and evening dose of .0625, right at the time my subs went generic (no idea if correlated or not). I attributed it to the fact that I got 3 vaccines at the same time and had a bad reaction, but I'm wondering if I was actually just in low level withdrawal that whole time because this week has not been much different from the last few months. 

I haven't used any pharmaceutical comfort drugs through the process, just the things I mentioned before (magnesium, high dose vitamin c powder, broad spectrum (no thc) CBD, strong passionflower tea, valerian root).  Its all working so I dont dare take anything out of the mix right now.

You NEED TO see some sort of therapist, group therapy and even a psychiatrist depending on whether you have other mental health issues like depression that you can get medicine for. There is just something in our brains that we are missing that made us miserable and drugs filled that void. But obviously, that’s not how we’re supposed to “fix” ourselves. However, you’ve taken a HUGE step to recovery and be proud of yourself!! Be proud of being able to take a life saving medication because you couldn’t be that addict on the street anymore. So while yes, many of us are tapering (or jumping which I never could have done lmao) because it’s kind of backfired on us. Suboxone isn’t working or helping us positively anymore. We’ve been there whether tapering or not. We get it. We can help you because of us being there regardless. You’ll get through this, too!


**My update:**

So as it says, 168 hours aka 7 days without suboxone and I’m doing fine! I don’t think my laziness or sleepiness has changed since I’ve stopped but I think my brain has a lot of adjusting to do still. Anyone ever feel bad for their brain? Lmao poor thing is on overload and chemically all over the place 😂. 

Of course, I’m proud of myself. It’s been very easy for me but that’s because, as I’ve said in all my updates, I went very slow and very low, I had really no symptoms. Whether the vitamin c has helped, I’m sure it has. I can’t say for sure cause I haven’t not drank it yet while at this stage. I did have some slight leg cramps and restless leg so I took a tiny tiny amount of Gabapentin and went to sleep. My stomach is still off but I’ve been dealing with they for like 2 months anyway so I’m fine with it.

I think the best thing to be able to say is that there’s no suboxone in me anymore or any opiate for that nagger. And really not drugs. I’m prescribed Xanax and Adderall but those are not abused. If you know my story, you know this was more of a doctors mistake (I’m not gonna go for malpractice because I can’t say for sure if I would’ve become an addict or not and it is what it is now) as to being put on suboxone but I admit to becoming addicted to it. 

I have zero cravings. I knew I wouldn’t have any. I was just really worried I’d wanna put a piece under my tongue but only because of it being part of my ritual for 4.5 years. I was trying to think of placebos and came up with orange tic tacs but turns out I didn’t need anything. But I’ve kind of so replaced it with vitamin c in some way. OCD sucks 😂. 

All in all, I’m doing fine. If you’re tapering or not, remember you kick ass and can get through it🤘🏼! I’m here if anyone needs to chat/has questions.","['TP', 'PPE']",0,0,1,0,1,0

626,ck8hpb,"Propranolol and Withdrawals. So I jumped for the second time off 500mcg Suboxone. This time I did not tell my pharmacist and instead cut off contact with my pharmacy (let my script lapse beforehand) specifically so I couldn't run back to them like a crybaby as soon as I started feeling sick, which I was feeling quite badly now at Day 4.

Mainly anxiety, racing heart, horribly aching legs and terrible lumbago, sweating episodes, feeling cold as a corpse and weak as a kitten, sneezing, yawning, watery eyes, unable to concentrate on anything beyond really simple tasks doing the dishes and walking down the street, exhausted but cannot sleep etc.

So I was searching on the internet on how withdrawal actually works chemically and stumbled on this [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851054/)  which points out that many of the withdrawal symptoms are actually caused not by a sudden lack of endorphins but way down at the primitive brain stem, due to a massive upregulated overabundance of the fundamental neurotransmitter noradrenaline when stopping opiates.

Cut a long story short, I then google noradrenaline antagonists, and up comes the result: ""Two examples of competitive adrenergic **antagonists** are propranolol and phentolamine."" (Propranolol is used to lower blood pressure but also as an anxiolytic as it slows down the heart rate, and inhibits the ""fight or flight"" response.)

I have been taking propranolol as needed for years and have a big supply. I took two (x 40mg), twice my usual dose (it's okay, I used to take three or even four when I had really bad hangovers so I could function without going into total panic) and have to say feel quite a lot better although that could be placebo I guess.

But the Wikipedia article on propranolol does mention it's used in withdrawal, so...

627,clpf5s,"Unforeseen downside to using Vitamin C to eliminate my withdrawals. When I first posted how well pure Vitamin C powder worked for eliminating physical withdrawal symptoms. There was one gentleman who commented and said that he *needed* to experience the pain of the withdrawal process as it would later be the thing that would keep him from ever going back. I admired his strength and tenacity but I couldn't understand why someone would want to experience such horrific withdrawal symptoms if they didn't have to. I just couldn't understand it. But now, I do. 

I should start by saying that yes, of course Vitamin C powder does not work for everyone because nothing does. But it does work far more often than not if used in the right form (pure powder) and a high enough dose. For me it was an absolute Godsend. I tried and failed so many times before I discovered Vitamin C. I was on 24mg/day of Suboxone and I was able to rapidly taper all the way down to 2mg in just a few weeks and jump straight off from there with very mild discomfort. My prior attempts without Vitamin C were pure agony and I never made it past day 5. But with high/frequent doses of Vitamin C powder, 80% of my withdrawal symptoms (including RLS, extreme fatigue and cold sweats) would completely subside for a solid 4 hours until my next dose. 

By day 20 I was feeling better physically than I had during the whole time that I was on Suboxone. I was no longer taking the Vitamin C at this point because I just didn't need it. When my dose of Vitamin C would wear off and no withdrawal symptoms would creep up, that's when I knew I had fully made it through the physical aspect. 

By day 30, I don't think I had ever been more proud of myself. It was the very first time in my [adult] life that I was completely substance free. But mentally I was a wreck. I was so painfully depressed and could barely muster up the motivation to complete the simplest of tasks, like take a shower or make a cup of coffee. Physically I felt great but mentally I felt completely useless. After such an incredible accomplishment, I went and threw it all away by ordering some kratom online to help with my depression and lack of motivation. Before I knew it,I was redosing compulsively throughout the entire day and it only took a couple weeks until I was taking well over 20gpd and waking up in the middle of the night with RLS until I'd get out of bed and redose. I felt more trapped than ever and I felt so ashamed of myself for making it so far just to throw it all away. 

The complete lack of energy and motivation was what did me in. I felt completely useless and I was starting to fail at my business because I had no drive whatsoever. But in hindsight, I can see that I was so much closer than I realized. Had I just stuck it out after those first 30 days, I am sure that things would have only continued to get better and better from that point on. And by this time, I would be feeling better and stronger than ever. But instead I made a full 360 and am right back where I started. My kratom addiction became so out of hand and was wreaking havoc on my physical and mental health as well as having devastating effects on my appearance (extreme hair loss, deep wrinkles, muscle loss, etc) I was helplessly addicted and ultimately returned to Suboxone out of complete desperation. After 113 days of being completely off of it, here I am right back where I started. Talk about feeling defeated. 

My point is this, by using Vitamin C to make my withdrawal period easy and virtually painless, I was far less reluctant to throw away my progress. Vitamin C made it so easy for me to get off of Suboxone that I figured, what's the big deal if I have to start over again? And now I understand exactly what that gentleman meant when he said that he *needed* to experience the pain of withdrawal as it would later serve as his motivator to stay clean. I used Vitamin C powder and it made my detox a cake walk but in the end, is that truly such a good thing? Had I grit my teeth and sweat through weeks of sleepless nights to make it to 30 days, I'm quite certain I would have been far more reluctant to throw it away.

Anyways, I just wanted to share this experience 
because after wanting everyone to know how amazing and effective Vitamin C powder truly is, I felt obligated to share what was a truly unforeseen down side to making withdrawal ""easy"". No pain no gain I suppose.

639,csjdoz,"Zubsolv Trick!. Hi all! 

Just a little background:

I have been constantly on some form of buprenorphine for about 2 years now, but have been in recovery on and off since July of 2014. Currently, and really for the past 3.5 years, my life has been incredible (for the most part). I finished my Masters degree, have an amazing partner, go to AA meetings, have a career, and am (once again for the most part) an honest, contributing member of society.

Of course, though, I do not really talk about being on MAT in meetings due to the stigma (this is another issue for another post). But MAT and buprenorphine work for me, and I happily consider myself as being a person in long-term recovery.

Anyway, I digress.

I just wanted to share a quick trick that works wonders for me with my Zubsolv (which I switched to from Suboxone about 8 months ago). I take between 1 and 2 5.7/1.3mg zubsolv tablets per day, typically split in half and taken every 5 or 6 hours. Sometimes I need a little more, sometimes a little less. But I am prescribed the equivalent of 16 mgs of suboxone per day.

I noticed that tucking the tablet between my lower lip and gum results in a much steadier absorption for me, with less medicated-saliva being swallowed than the normal, under-the-tongue route. It usually takes about 45 minutes to completely dissolve, and I can generally eat, drink, and talk this way. I feel like more medication is absorbed, AND it is absorbed at a much steadier rate. 

Honestly, it makes every other method pale in comparison. I feel much more balanced, and it has made a wold of difference for me. 

Just wanted to share this experience in case some of you are having a tough time adapting to their medication. 

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, and this is my own experience and not medical advice. 

Another disclaimer: I shared this with my doctor, who was completely okay with this method and agreed that it could work better for some people. Buprenorphine can be absorbed both through the mucous membranes all throughout the mouth--so this makes sense.",['MA'],0,1,0,0,0,0

I’ve been on subs since the beginning of this year, I was on 8mg for ~3 months or so, then I started my tapering process around April, which was nothing strict, or constant, I just never went back up and stayed on a dose till I felt okay.

8 to 2mg by 1mg increments... now I’m at 1mg per day.. 0.5mg morning and 0.5mg at night. From 8 to 2mg I felt nothing physical, very slightly mental. Now that I’m at 1mg for 1 week my energy is significantly reduced, muscle pains are strong, but that’s about it.

I have enough left to stay on 1mg for 1 more week, 0.5 for 2 weeks, 0.25 for 2 weeks... and I doubt I can go any lower with that considering I have 8mg strips, but I’ll have a few mg left over just in case I need to extend those weeks.

I’m extremely scared of my energy being non-existent when I get off completely, since taking subs I really feel like it increases my energy a lot.

Have had 3 back surgeries. I'm on a very high dose of both. Like alot. But even on these high doses I'm still in a lot of pain and my stomach has been hurting every day for about 2 years. (I'm retaining gas like crazy but have a BM daily so it's not constipation) I've been checked top and bottom and all tests are normal. Except for gerd and Dr saying I have IBS. Which I don't think is a real diagnosis. But anyhow I am thinking about switching to buprenorphine. I take my meds every 3 hrs as prescribed. How long would I have to hold off before I could take buprenorphine? I'm willing to put up with the pain if it means I'll feel better as a result. I've heard everything from 12-24 hours. That sounds like a nightmare but my life has been a nightmare anyhow. Don't misunderstand me the meds are working just nowhere as well as they once did. Just wanting to get out of the clock watching mentality. I'm also scared that if I go this route I'll be screwed forever if it doesn't work out. I'm not addicted but I am dependent. Just looking for some good advice. I'd like to think that I could have a life again. Tired of the same thing every day. Just want to feel as close to normal as possible. Thanks for anyone who gives advice or makes suggestions. I've helped a few friends get into MAT so I know a little about it but have never personally tried it.,"['MA', 'PPE', 'CDU']",0,1,1,1,0,0
647,cvvjks,"How I avoided the jump with a water taper. Background-abused many things for about 7 years. Dope, oxys, everything. Took methadone for several years later,  before taking suboxone for almost 5. I got on suboxone as a short term solution which turned into several years of trying to detox. I probably tried to go cold turkey from a low dose (1mg) a few times without success. I had a hard time functioning while tapering at such a low dose. It’s upsetting they don’t make doses smaller than 2mg in the states. Made it very challenging. I work full time and have bills to pay. Taking a month off was never an option. I had amazing success after doing a water taper. I took a glass bottle with a dropper, and put four 2mg strips into it. I then measured out 16 droppers full of mouthwash and mixed it all in the bottle. I knew one dropped equaled half a mg. The alcohol in the mouthwash I believed helped me absorb the sub, making me feel better quickly before considering more. Once that was down I put less sub in the solution. After a month I took a week off work. I broke one 2mg down into 20 droppers worth and only took some if I needed to. A week later I was done with everyday doses. I took a few more .1 doses on random nights I needed good rest for work. I skipped my next doctors appointment so I didn’t refill but kept them in the loop. Once I finished the last bottle I was done. It’s been 8 months. Took me two months to regulate my sleeping pattern. My stomach is still a bit off from over ten years of abuse, but I’m done. Like many of you I did tons and tons of internet searching, hoping to find something that made it easier. Tried Kratom, smoked tons of green. Nothing worked like the water taper. It helped me slowly come down without heavy withdrawal. I never thought I would  be able to get off it, but I am. This worked for me. Hopefully it works for someone else. I hope my story can give someone hope so they can spend their days not knowing how many subs you have to make it through the week, or the month. To not wake up and think of it, or lay in bed thinking a small dose will help you rest better. It caused me to feel insane, but that’s addiction. All of you be strong out there. If you haven’t gotten off it, remember there are many of us out there that were full blown arrested by this stuff and we got free. No one is locked in for life.

648,cw6hzf,"First day of jump - a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Here we go.   
I know, I know, you dont feel anything the first day (except anxiety mixed with some anticipation), but still feels like a big step. I've been on 4mg subutex for close to 7 years and tapered down to 0.2mg before the jump. I would have tapered lower but I chickened out. I was on 0.2mg for six weeks (the longest I stayed on a dose below 4mg) and had finally gotten a little better and less anxious but I guess it's one more ride on the roller coaster.   
I felt insanely anxious first part of the day, couldnt keep still coupled with zero energy but all that was 100% mental, I'm sure. Tomorrow I'm checking into rehab, to be on the safe side, but I have no idea when the bad stuff is gonna hit me,  
I'm assuming it's gonna be hell intensified, something close to my 0.8-0.4mg taper, but much much worse, but I dont know yet.   


So my questions is: How soon did the really bad wd's hit you on this kind of jump? Third day? Fifth day? How long did the excruciating pain last? And, more importantly, and more subjectively, how long before any sense of normality (even if it was just elation from the worst being over)? I know I'm looking at, what, 3 months of low serotonin suicidal depression, but I'd love to hear more stories and experiences.  


I'm actually giddy as I write this. I know it's early doors, still room for relapse and whatnot, call me a fool, but I'm genuinely excited. Like I said, I know the pain dodn't hit until day three or whatever, but it's still my first full day without subs for 7 years.","['PPE', 'TP']",0,0,1,0,1,0
649,cw7yct,"Having sudden side effects after years on sub. This is a fairly long post, but I am in desperate need of help and I could really use some feedback about this situation. Thank you in advance for anyone that is willing to take the time to read this and give me some input. 

I've been on Suboxone/Subutex for about 5 years. Besides minor headaches (reason for switching to Subutex) I've always reacted extremely well to bupe. My morning dose gives me a surge of energy and makes me productive and personable at work. As much as I love opiates, subs have always made me feel more 'myself' than any other drug. 

Unfortunately, everything changed last week. I took my morning dose (about 2mg) and started feeling very strange about a half hour later. I felt sort of dizzy and my stomach started to turn. Before long, I was extremely nauseous and clammy, and I started puking. The dizziness and nausea lasted for hours, and I also became uncontrollably sleepy, like full-on nodding off. 

When this first happened, I convinced myself that it must have been dehydration. I did not take my 2nd dose that day, so I woke up in withdrawal the next morning. Thinking nothing of the day before, I took my dose like normal. Sure enough.. same dizzy nauseous feeling came right back. 

This has continued for the past week. I've been researching and trying different things to resolve it, but nothing has worked. I've been spitting out the excess meds after taking my dose instead of swallowing, which only makes me feel slightly better, but its clear that I am not ingesting the same dose as before, so I don't feel like I got the full effect. 

I'm really feeling hopeless about this situation. My work performance has been poor, and I just can't function in general. I have lowered my dose to the bare minimum that it will take me to not be sick, since taking the full dose makes me sick in a different way.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? I could go into more detail, but I don't want this post to be insanely long. Here are a few other things that should be taken into account: 

I've been on a 'keto' diet for the past few months. Little to no carbs, lots of meat and fat in my diet. I've been fairly 'backed up' recently, and I thought that may have been the issue, since I read that constipation can cause some of the symptoms I've been having. However, without going into too much detail, I was able to clear out my system on Sunday, and I am still having the same issues. 

I usually do feel dehydrated, but this has been pretty consistent throughout my time on subs. I've made it a real point to hydrate like crazy since this started happening, so I don't think that is the problem. 

I did just switch from generic Subutex to Actavis brand last week. However, the first day that I had these effects was actually still on the generic meds before the switch.","['MA', 'PPE']",0,1,1,0,0,0
650,cwhaj7,"Are there any SUB users that are on testosterone replacement as well?. We all pretty much know what bupe does to our sex drive or lack there of.. I’m now approaching 11 months of being on subs and while life has improved immensely, I can definitely say that subs have killed my sex drive. After lurking this subreddit and the web as well, I’m beginning to consider asking my doctor about possibly putting me on testosterone replacement therapy. 

If anyone has been in my same situation and is taking /taken TRT, I’m curious how it’s been working  out for you. What differences have you noticed / any improvements? 

I would appreciate some honest feedback and advice from those who have sought out help while continuing to remain on suboxone during the TRT. 

Obviously the best solution would be to work towards getting off the subs, which id like to hear from those who have done so as well.

658,d05soj,"Update 7.5 weeks. So it’s been 7.5 weeks! I guess it’s been a few days since I last updated. I was having a lot of trouble with a few issues like having my period and being sick plus PAWS. It was really hard but I got through it and feel normal again! Tired but more normal for sure. I’m not dizzy like I was and I’m not having that awful disconnected derealization feeling. 

Before I was even on Suboxone, as some of you know, I was abusing my Vicoprofen that I had for my back for a few months. Not enough to get on Suboxone for 4.5 years but I obviously did end up getting addicted to Suboxone. Almost every day for 4.5 years, I took Advil for my back. Being it’s a blood thinner, I ended up bruising insanely easily. My legs were covered in bruises and having a puppy jumping on me just made me bruise even more. I have to get to my primary to get a full blood work up to check my liver after all that Advil. I am also going to be seeing a new orthopedic to figure out what’s going on. 

That being said, on Saturday I was in such immense pain I took 10mg of Oxycodone. Of course it made me feel good and took the pain away. I was dancing the day before and fucked up my neck haha. I’m in pain daily and being I don’t wanna keep taking Advil, I’ve taken 1 of the 5mg Oxycodone each day since Saturday except today. I’m not withdrawing or anything. Obviously my moms holding on to the pain meds and I’m not taking more than that. I’m very self aware thankfully and my mom, my therapist and my best friend know about it. I’m not getting the exercise I should be. I’m not being kept busy. It all makes sense as to why I’d want it. So I’m going to be working on that for sure. I just feel like a total failure. I feel I cheated. I actually feel I disappointed everyone here and I’m sorry if I did😔. I wouldn’t consider this a “relapse”. But I’m so sad. 

Other than that issue, I’m actually doing well. The last 3 weeks were definitely tough but I had no choice than to push through cause what else could I do?

659,d179bx,"8 weeks off Suboxone & today I went to New York City. It has been 8 weeks since I got off Suboxone. For 4.5 years, I was just a person existing in the world. I didn’t leave home. I didn’t leave the couch. I missed some of the biggest events in my best friends life during those years and I’ll never be able to relive it. It was rare for me to even shower as gross as that is/sounds. The only reason I left home was to see my psychiatrist and go to the pharmacy to pick up my suboxone. 

While the last 3 weeks were rough and this past week I’ve had to take 5mg Oxycodone once or twice a day for my back pain, I’m doing so much better. As the title says, I went to NYC today! I took the train in with my brother and met up with my dad, his wife and my aunt. We learned how to make pizza. My dad and I made ours together and it turned out delicious! Also, I had never met his wife. My dad had an affair with her and broke my mom to pieces. I have talked to his wife on the phone and FaceTime but I couldn’t bring myself to meet her in person. I have always felt as if I was betraying my mom who did NOTHING wrong for my dad to have this affair and lie to my mom (and me and my brothers) for soo many years. I also didn’t want to meet his wife and have my mom be at home alone knowing where I am and who I’m meeting. My moms my best friend and I tell her everything so it has just been very hard to meet get the courage to meet his wife. Her and my dad moved away in March and they were here to pack up their house as it had finally sold and that’s why we met up today (Saturday). It went great. I really like his wife. I did my best to make her as comfortable as I could because I didn’t want this to be a big deal. I had her take a picture with me and we all took a group photo as well that I forced her in to bring apart of. My dad has changed a lot and I actually felt more uncomfortable with him than I did his wife. 

Anyway, this is just a big step for me and I feel good mentally and physically for the most part. I’d say if it were 4 months ago, you’d NEVER catch me doing this. To those tapering and probably feeling like shit, I can officially say, IT GETS BETTER AND YOU WILL BE OK!

0.1mg Clonidine - 2-3x a day
300mg Lyrica - 2x a day

If you go back through my posts you'll see I had a fairly easy time. The helper meds took almost all symptoms away and all I experienced was fatigue.

So the update, I wanted to start by saying I think Suboxone is a great way to get off opiates. It helped me emensely.

It's not like I feel completely different now, but I definately feel better. I feel like I'm less in a fog, that I'm more aware of my life and my decisions. I've already managed to lose 10lbs and have been sticking to. Ketogenic Diet that I wasn't ever able to do while on Suboxone. I have way less mood swings and especially don't get very low moods at night anymore. I was waking up every couple hours while on Suboxone and that has now completely dissapeared. Its taken until about 1.5 weeks ago but I can even fall asleep right away and then don't wake up until the morning. I don't have this anxiety about worrying about withdrawal anymore. I just generally feel better. Oh, and I know this doesn't make sense. But I was a chronic relapser while on Suboxone. Only ever going 2-4 months without having a couple days of using opiates. I'm now at 6months without a relapse and I haven't even been getting cravings anymore. Not sure what else to report but feel free to ask me anything.

671,d6j9pp,"Me again...here’s my fear:. I’ve been posting and reading here since I jumped from 2mg subs in mid-July. I can’t say I’m not an addict because I admit I love being in altered states. 

However, I also have degenerative osteoarthritis throughout my body. It’s in my hands, feet, lower back and I’ve broken major bones that never quite healed right. And I have a huge bunion on my right foot. Basically, I’m always in some mid-high level of pain. It’s especially bad after being still for any period of time. I’m almost 50 but look like I’m 30 (it’s the only good genes I inherited). But, I think it makes it difficult for doctors to take me seriously. I look healthy and young until they X-ray my body. Even then, they don’t want to prescribe painkillers because (duh) they’re addictive. 

So I went the suboxone route for 5 years. I jumped through all the typical hoops and the doctors office got to know me. They understood that I was taking suboxone for pain management and taking it as prescribed. No dirty pee-tests because suboxone helped with my pain—I didn’t need anything else to function/work/live. I only drank alcohol and the docs overlooked it. We had an understanding at the office which is RARE, I know. 

And then, they had to start cracking down on alcohol. Zero tolerance even for casual drinkers like myself. I decided that I was tired of peeing in a cup every other month and I simply don’t want to fully abstain from drinking. 

TLDR/what happens when my degenerative osteoarthritis makes life unbearable? With the way the government is cracking down on opioids, will they be available when I desperately need them to physically get out of bed?

Either way today I am going to try and take a 2nd dose of maybe 2mg of sub as I have to do this to finish the Bernese Method. After I dose 2 days in a row 2x a day.

711,u97cp1,"Day 10 jumping from 2mg. Hey guys, just wanted to give an update on my journey. I am nearly done w/ day 10 jumping off 2mg subs, and I was on 4-2mg for a couple years. In days 4-7 I was in really bad shape. At certain points of the day all I could do was sit in a fetal position on my bed in agony. Tried to get my mind off things by playing video games but I just couldn't do it. You know that shitty feeling where your body is restless but your mind is tired af? Yeah it was like an extreme version of that. Sitting down felt like shit but I was simultaneously too tired to move my body. Had practically 0 appetite and my digestive system was in a knot. My sense of temperature was completely fucked too, I'd feel super hot one moment and then freezing the next. For comfort meds I've been using alprazolam (i normally don't take benzos), kratom (plan to stop that in a few days from now), magnesium supplements, and melatonin for sleep.

But after last night, I started to feel much better. And tonight I feel SO much better, physically speaking. Someone commented on my last post that day 10 is where things can really turn around for the better and they were 100% right. I'm still tired but all that aching and wanting to jump out of my skin feeling has subsided like 90%. A few days ago, whenever I'd take Kratom, it would only give me relief for like 1 hour and then I would feel the sub WDs again. But today even without Kratom I don't feel that bad. I also slept last night for 6 hours straight which was really good considering nights before that I couldn't sleep for more than 3 hours increments before the WDs would wake me up. Also got in a good workout today which I believe helped.

My physical symptoms atm really just consist of: light lethargy, yawning, sniffles, diarrhea, and a tiny bit of RLS at certain times. Not even as bad as a light cold tbh at this point. Like I said, as far as physical WDs go, I feel they're about 90% reduced in intensity. Today is the first full day where I truly felt like I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. On day 5-6 ngl there were moments where I almost wanted to die. Never been suicidal and I have a lot to live for, but I just couldn't imagine enduring a whole month of that bs. Thank god things are really finally turning around. I think after just a couple more days, the battle will be basically purely psychological.

This is definitely the longest I've gone without subs in years and I am proud of that. Last time I tried going CT from 10mg and only lasted until day 6. I know I could've tapered lower this time but situations happened to where I had to jump from 2mg, and tbh tapering was always quite challenging for me anyways. Still, if you can, always try to taper to the lowest possible dose, of course.

My pharmacy right now is staffed with old ladies who replace the usual staff who are on vacation, so for the first time in about 8 years I get told that she will call me back. I want to verify with them if this is just temporary like the last time they were only having those 155 / Actavis logo (Moon) Suboxones....

Just 2 months ago, I was getting Pharmascience (PMS), one of the best overall generics company in Canada, they looked and tasted less like Mr Clean (heh, despite my name, not a fan of the odor or taste I guess), when I had the brand name ones, it was clearly indicated they had lime and lemon natural and artificial flavouring in there, I guess to make snorting a bit painful (it was, I didn't do that for long) and to those who insist on IV'ing them, even the best SteriFilt at .22 microns will not remove a flavour that will stay in the liquid (just a hint not to bother doing that - tsk tsk, for your veins sake). 

They looked just the same as the brand name, N8 and the Sword, except at some point the sides were flattened,back in June or so and worked fine. The Actavis pills I found were very mild on the taste (which is good for one's teeth), but the effects are not as profoundly relieving as the PMS ones.

2 weeks ago, I got what was the rest of the PMS pills, they bothered putting on the sticker saying the pills might look different because I had a blend of PMS and ACT pills. Might be considering the film since it showed up here this year next time I meet my doc in a few weeks, he offered them but apparently there's some dose adjusting that I really don't feel like going through if it's something that could have me need to stay inpatient for a few days, stayed inpatient 9 years ago when I got on methadone first, Suboxone was pretty new then and not paid for by any insurance in my province, so it wasn't discussed much, the 6 days in the inpatient clinic was such hell (they mixed alcoholics and cokeheads with those addicted to their painkillers a bit too much....theres no heroin here thank god...if there is, those drive a LONG way to get something that isn't likely worth it since pills just as strong are going around anyways).   


tl;dr Anyone else from Canada (or not) find the Actavis generic Suboxones the lowest tier when it comes to generic Subs? Because PMS and Teva generics are way better and almost impossible to differentiate from the brand name, except the brand name's taste is even stronger and more awful. I hear the films soon will be having a choice for an Orange taste, like the original US Suboxones, I told my doctor : about time! Those lime and lemon extracts cost me a whole lot of dental work! I had 2 small cavities in 30 years or so before getting on Subs, after that, I probably got over 25 fillings (TG I have insurance that pays for white filling everywhere and not just the front teeth). Sorry for the long post, I'm kind of not enjoying being 3/4 where I should be with these Actavis subs.","['AL', 'MA']",1,1,0,0,0,0

Turns out, my GP insisted on labs & an office visit to keep prescribing my daily meds (like nausea ones, lmao - thought I was slick). Turns out, yes, I was in full blown w/d's from both. Never been so sick, I couldn't handle alcohol for more than a day or two. He put me on Librium without lecturing me & suggested some free AA meetings. I sweated so much, the cover on his table stuck to my clothes. After 2 psych docs turned me down for substance abuse help, my effing GP - totally averse to controlled substances - made my life bearable & had a sense of humor about it. He even told me once this is over, I can have a drink a day if I feel like I can handle it. So, for anybody struggling & looking for help, you can find it in some unlikely places. Kewp trying.

718,gq66rl,"Tips and or help with getting off Subutex. So first I will start by saying, I am in full support of Bupe, it saves life, anything to do to get off the dope is great, therefore I think subs are great for that. 

However, I have been on subs for about 8 year, and it worked great in the beggining, and it still works good,, but recently I have been wanting to get off of it. 8 years is along time, and idk where to even start. I

Like I said I think Bupe is great for it's purpose, but latley I have been wanting to get off it for many reasons. The main being is what is doing to my teeth (And i'm only 28) along with other possible health reasons, and i'm sick of being a slave to my doctor and the pharmacy. Plus I just feel like it's time, and this is the first time I have personally ever wanted to get off, so in my heart I want to, but the physical dependency has made me procrastinate attempting to get off subs. And every time I google it looking to get off of it, all I see is horror stories, and that also has held me back.

I will add I also take Klonopin, however that is mainly because I have a small case of epilepsy (very small case), just figured i'd add that as a side note.

So in conclusion, I don't want to turn 30 and still be on subs (Not that that is bad, I just personally feel like it's time to get off). And if I get off of it and need to get back on it, I can at least say I gave myself a chance and tried to quit.

If this helps, I would also like to add that I am perscribed 60 8 mg tabs a month, but only take 1 to 1 and a half every day now. So if anyone has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated. I really want to hear a success story of people getting off of them, because it seems I only read unsuccesful stories on the internet. And i'm aware it's not gona be a walk in the park, and will probally suck for awhile.

I will also add 1 more thing, I live in Texas and got caught with some THC gummy bears about 2 months ago, so I may be looking at jail time because edibles are poss CS PG, and my charge was Poss CS PG 2 between 4 and 400 Grams, which is a second degree felony in Texas. I had  1 personal baggie with 8 gummy worms and they weighed obver 4 G's total. My lawyer had told me he doesn't think I will do anymore actual jail time, but I will still serve my time, just outside of jail from what he said. Only reason I bring that up is because if do have to do some time, I do not want to go through that in jail if I have to go.

Anyways, and suggestions/ advice, etc... would be greatly appreciated.","['TP', 'PPE']",0,0,1,0,1,0

My rule has been to cut my dose a couple of weeks after the symptoms subside from dropping down, but I haven’t been able to stabilize at .25 yet. It’s been a while. I wonder if it has to do with the difficulty in getting a consistent dose; some days feel better than others. Thinking I might just drop again anyway, or even just jump from here.

I am trying to live a pretty healthy lifestyle. I eat fairly clean and keep busy. Sometimes a good workout feels better than dope ever did. Especially some cardio, try that shit out; I hope it makes you feel as good as it does me.

I try not to do things that I know I will regret. Like going out and drinking. Sometimes it can be lonely bc a lot of my friends live that life but I know it’s holding them back on being their best self. 

I haven’t yet figured out exactly where I want to go in life. I have a decent job that I’m very fortunate to have, but I know I’m capable of greater things. 

I’ve talked a lot about me, I want to hear how y’all are doing. Much love",['PPE'],0,0,1,0,0,0
755,nai1ed,"How do I begin taking subs again while dependent on Fentanyl aka the world's shittiest sleep med. (Bernese method). Okay.. So I realllly could use your help. I'm currently dependent on Fentanyl, about a gram-2 gram a day habit. I read up on the Bernese Method which is currently listed below. The issue I have is right now money is tight and i'm not guaranteed to have my dose of H (Or F if you'd prefer to be specific).  So if i'm on Day 4 and take 2mg and don't have anything to take i'm going to go into precipitated withdrawal, which if you're so lucky to have never experienced - then you are so fortunate. It is complete HELL on earth. It's regular withdrawal shot up 10x and it comes on all at once. Reason being, you're raping your opioid receptors of anything in there immediately. I'm so sick of being sick. Rehab just isn't an option right now which SUCKS. But I really want to get clean. If you have any advice please don't hesitate to respond. No response is dumb. Thank you so much for your time. 

Bernese Method for introducing Suboxone into the body: 

* Day 1: 0.5 mg once a day
* Day 2: 0.5 mg twice a day
* Day 3: 1 mg twice a day
* Day 4: 2 mg twice a day
* Day 5: 3 mg twice a day
* Day 6: 4 mg twice a day
* Day 7: 12 mg (stop other opioids)","['CDU', 'MA', 'PPE']",0,1,1,1,0,0

759,wdngc2,"It's always now. I realize this isn't directly related to Suboxone in a traditional sense, but it totally is.  I personally am a fan of Sam Harris, I know many people can't stand him,[but listen to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSIAMaAYYj0) and just let your mind absorb a little of it.  I think nothing characterizes how we got here in the first place more than this.  The TLDR is that we get wrapped up in our lives, always reflecting on the past or anticipating the future and lose track of now.  He says ""The problem is that too many people realize they spent their limited time chasing the wrong things.""  That's why addiction is so evil. B/c you spend your time focused on the wrong thing - and little by little it moves up on the list of things that are important in your life and for most people, it gets there quickly.  It crowds out everything else.  


The reason sub is such an important drug is that it gives you a chance to care about what's most important (b/c it's safe) and b/c it lets you immediately quit focusing  on getting more.  If taken properly it literally forces opiates down lower and lower to the things you spend your time thinking about, caring about.    


We've seen a few posts lately about the whole issue about ""Are you clean on Subs"" and I vocally say ""Yes"".  B/c you're not putting yourself at risk of harm.  B/c you're not focused on getting anything else. B/c you're able to immediately snap out of it and start caring about all the other little things that became a casualty of the addiction.",['OTH'],0,0,0,0,0,1

I’m not sure what exactly it was but yea I relapsed again… 

I just left the doctor after sleeping for the last 2 days neglecting my wife and kids… I struggle from having to take kolonopin 2x a day which works- I was taking 4+ Xanax a day and for the last 2 years I have been good with 2 klonopin a day… I just took an 8mg suboxone at the doc office and I feel like I can see and feel clearly again… I am going to have to start back up on subs - never have I felt so lost… I feel like I will lose my family if things don’t change, despite my wife being a nurse herself it’s hard to talk to her and let her know what’s going on- I always feel like I’m being judged (this may be 100% mental but wanted feedback).

768,c3ij0h,"Been IV'ing subs for almost 4 months straight, no problems at all. But I'm scared shitless now after reading posts. So basically I IV subs, very very small quantities, .25 to .5 mg of an 8mg strip at a time 3x a day. It seems to work much better than sublingual dose. I get a slight rush 5 mins in and i feel mild euphoria. I look forward to it each morning. I am basically an IV suboxone addict. 

I have not ONCE experience a hardening of the veins. In fact I still dont need a belt to inject and i do the exact same place each time. I started doing this November 2017 and have been off and on IVing subs, with either a few days or week of heroin in between, and a few months on kratom as well. The total number of months ive done this is probably 13 months or so. 

Everyone told me not to do it but i never had the problems they told me id experience so my addict self tells me why should i stop? My life has been much better in this recent run of IV subs. I actually have a life unlike when i was homeless and broke on heroin. I can function so well and have desire to live. My life fucking sucks dick right now anyways, so many things out of my control, that the IV subs is the only thing I feel keeping me from relapsing.

So now you know why I continue to IV. Is there ANYONE out there with experience in my situation? Anyone else not had any physical problems shooting?? I'm reading about neuropathy and endocarditis and I'm scared shitless, now my arm feels numb and weird but it might just be me thinking that. I exercise like crazy and drink water and eat well and like i said I dont shoot much at all.

Back story: I've been on suboxone since 2012 so I was on the name brand strips for many years and then switched to the Sandoz generic when insurance stopped covering the brand name. No issues at all with that, I could tell no difference, as the Sandoz generic is made by the brand name company. 

Years go by with me on Sandoz when suddenly earlier this year they filled my script with Alvogen. Now don't get me wrong, for those who are new to suboxone or don't have much prior experience with the brand name, Alvogen will probably work just fine, but for those of us old timers used to the higher quality, Alvogen is just not quite up to par. The packaging to the strip itself just feels ""cheap"" and ""nasty"" to me. Even so I still gave them a try and after about a week on them, I could tell this was not for me. 

When my next script was due to be filled I called CVS and requested they only fill my perscriptions with Sandoz; they had no issue with that as I'm a good customer and don't usually give them any shit. They marked my account as SANDOZ PREFERRED and all was well for months, till I got a new script this week. The pharmacist called saying they did not have enough Sandoz to fill my prescription so they gave me a partial fill of 3 days worth of Sandoz and ordered more Sandoz. I called to check the next day and they said the order came in but it was Alvogen, so they put in another order for Sandoz. Now I'm thinking oh shit, I'm going to be stuck with these awful yellow strips going forward like others I've read about online. Another day goes by and I call CVS back, yet again the Sandoz did not come in but they said it should be in tomorrow. At this point I think they're just stringing me along but no, the third day after the third attempt at ordering the Sandoz, it did come in and I got my full script with it.

I've been taking opiates for 3 years. Oxy and dilauded, nothing harder than that. My peak was around 50-60 mg oxy a day. Not huge by most standards but enough to where not taking one was causing problems.

I started taking because of a knee injury. The pain was causing me to limp and being as my job keeps me on my feet all day, it was a necessary evil. I've since had a minor lower back injury which is yet another reason to take them to function.

My normal routine is a 7.5 mg at 10, 7.5 at 1/2, 7.5 at 4/5, 7.5 at 8/9, and often times another if needed around 11 before bed. And that's down from taking 10mg at a time before. I tried to go down to 5mg but it just didnt work the same and I found myself taking it every 2 hours vs every 3 or 4.

A friend of mine suggested suboxone. I really just want the pain relief and not the high. When I can get dills ill take them instead, as 6 mg dill typically works for the day. Ultimately I'd like to say fuck it and just take ibuprofen and suck it up.

Now heres my dilemma. I've gone 2 or 3 days without using and I've dealt with WD symptoms. Headaches, yawning, sweats, irritable, pain, and just an underwhelming desire to function day to day. I immediately got back on and just tried to manage the doses better.

So my friend suggested suboxone. Helps some with pain but doesnt give the high (I'm okay with that) and hopefully as a way to taper to nothing.

So if I go this route, what dose would be a good starting point? I've seen 8, I've seen 4, I've seen 2 ... I don't know how to gauge because I know others here have been in far worse straights than myself.

837,pcyv7u,"Never too late. I've been addicted to opiates since 2007 when OC 80s were prevalent in America. I destroyed many relationships and went to many rehabs where I would inevitably relapse after months clean. I used to be afraid of suboxone because in my mind I wanted to be clean of all opiates and was afraid of suboxone WD.

After over a decade of opiate addiction I finally said to myself that I'm going to try suboxone because I was so sick of having negative money and being sick every day. Inducing subs was a nightmare in itself because of fent being everywhere. I waited 72 hrs after my last fent dose and took 2mg of subs. I went into PWD but I toughed it out and laid in bed for 3 days next to a fan and heater so I never felt too hot or too cold.

I kept taking 2mg sub every 6 hours and eventually felt human again after about 5 days. I adjusted my dose up and down depending how I felt but I'm stable on 6mg a day for the last 9 months. Some morning cam be harder than others but I always feel normal 30 mins after my morning dose.

If you're in the US, suboxone is very easy to get, much easier than it was 5-10 years ago. The pandemic really opened alot of options for addicts with telehealth doctors being able to prescribe suboxone and comfort meds such as gabapentin, clonidine, etc. You can contact a telehealth such as bupe.me and get a script for a months worth of sub in the same day.

I know inducing subs can feel impossible but it's possible if you lower your dose and wait long enough. You can also try the Bernese method by slowly taking subs while using your DOC and slowly increasing the amount of subs you take while lowering the amount of your DOC.

I know being on subs isn't as ideal as being 100% clean, I wanted to be 100% clean so bad but I could never make it stick even when I was 90 days clean from everything after rehab. My quality of life is so much better on subs and for the first time in my life, I feel confident that I won't slip up and relapse on fent which could easily kill me.

I understand subs aren't for everyone and many people still feel cravings while on subs but my cravings have been minimal to almost non existant. I don't know how long I will stay on subs if not forever but I'm happy to be on it right now. My medical covers all my suboxone and is about to cover my monthly sublocade shot which costs over $1000 a month. I've heard tapering is easy on sublocade compared to tapering suboxone. I hope anyone reading this who's suffering can find hope if they are stuck in opiate addiction and to know that taking suboxone is ok especially if you've been addicted to opiates for years.","['PPE', 'AL', 'TP']",1,0,1,0,1,0
838,trpmzz,"Subs have basically ruined my life and I would be very appreciative for guidance and opinions. I should start by admitting that I am fully aware that I am more responsible for ruining my life than Suboxone is, but they seem to go hand in hand. I was diagnosed with a neurological disorder that causes long-term chronic pain; they prescribed oxycodone and I became addicted to it about 15 years ago, at the age of 24. It was a pretty intense addiction to the point where I was taking upwards of 100 mg whenever I could find it and basically spent all of the money I had. I went to rehab and stayed away from pain medicine for a long, long time. In the meantime, from my early 30s through my late 30s, I became a heavy drinker. I would drink about a pint of vodka a night, sometimes almost a fifth on Saturdays but one rule I never broke was that I literally never started drinking before 7:30 p.m., ever. Randomly one night while drinking my buddy had a Suboxone and I gave into temptation and took a small piece of one. It fucked me up fairly good but what it did more than anything was take away my physical pain more than any sort of oxycodone or oxycontin ever did. The next day when I woke up I was kind of skeptical in regard to the pain relief so I chalked it up to me being drunk. He gave me a few more that I took over the next week. I only took them while I was sober, and IT...WAS... LIFE-CHANGING!!! I was able to do things that I had not been able to do for over 10 years. When I say life-changing, I mean literally life-changing: It basically brought back my old life for all intents and purposes. So I went to a Suboxone doctor and lied. Told her I was still hooked on oxycodone so she gave me the suboxone. It was actually shockingly easy to get that prescribed, which I thought was kind of weird but that was my goal so I was okay with it. Everything was great for about 3 months, my life was going great, I was able to pick up some of my old healthy hobbies, it was literally a dream come true. Until one Saturday at noon I had a beer at lunch. I noticed that when I had a beer or two (with a dose or two of Suboxone in my system already) the buzz I got from it was exactly the same as when I was really hooked on oxycodone 15 years ago.




So I started having a beer or two a few times a week, fast forward 6 months and I am now drinking beer on and off throughout the day to the point where it's putting me to sleep when I get home from work. Nobody at work has said anything but I'm pretty sure they can probably tell that I am buzzed half the time. I don't know what to do. Even though I was a heavy drinker in the past, I never drank during the day and it never fucked with my life. But the feeling I get when I drink beer throughout the day with Subs, is strong enough to keep bringing me back to day-drinking. I know I need to quit drinking, but if I give up the Suboxone I'm going to have to give up all the things that I gained back when I started taking it... The ability to ride and own a motorcycle, standing on my feet for longer than 10 minutes, cooking in the kitchen without getting so fatigued I have to sit down after 15 minutes. If someone were to take an honest look and extrapolate that level of pain and fatigue throughout their own life, it will show them just how much it destroys a life. I mean, without the subs, I can't even get through taking a shower without taking numerous breaks to let my muscle fatigue and pain relent. Sorry for the long rant, I just honestly don't know what to do. It's clear that I need to stop drinking, and I have full confidence that I can, I was able to stop the pain medicine in the past, but this feels a little different. I have somehow associated the life-changing pain relief of the subs with the depression relief of the subs combined with the beer and I am completely lost. Any help is seriously really appreciated.

I need help persevering through these nauseating mental frenzies of self-doubt, self-loathing, lack of self-confidence, impostor syndrome, and literally crippling anxiety/anhedonia/hopelessness...  I'll try to keep it short, as my story is one of multiple traumas, repressed traumas, and even current trauma (I just lost my mom unexpectedly, I didn't even get to say goodbye or I love you, fml...).  I should rent a room in the goddamn trauma ward at this point.

When I first tried using subs to control and maintain the sliver of life I hadn't fully annihilated yet(yet...), it was hellish and I gave up.  Each time I went back, it got a tad easier (maybe, could be distorted perspective from the damn dirty 30s). But it was extremely hard on the body and mind, over and over.  This is what I struggle with so severely, that I've almost died a few times. I start going crazy mentally/emotionally.  It starts with one task I need to do, and then every single thing I've fucked up/slacked on/procrastinated/ruined from addiction BOMBARDS my mind and I'm like paralyzed with anxiety and self-doubt that I can even fix/clean/pay/maintain... Then the self-loathing creeps in from hating myself for not being able to do the things I've always done to have a relatively good life.  There's no happiness most of the time, no reward system.  I work my ass off at a very demanding and high-skill tech job, everyone praises me... Yet I feel like a phony, a fake, a loser regardless.  What can I do to start feeling stronger/better/confident like I used to feel?  I can't succumb to fucking up EVER AGAIN.  This is the last pass I give myself, then it gets drastic.  So I HAVE to overcome the addiction this time.  I think I can, but I know I need more tools in my sobriety arsenal for days like this where I SHOULD NOT HAVE FUCKED UP.","['CDU', 'PPE']",0,0,1,1,0,0

This will likely be my last post in this sub, it has been an invaluable resource to me during the very difficult first months of sobriety. A place to vent, ask questions, and generally feel less alone and miserable while withdrawing. 

What you need to know; No, I didn't taper. I jumped from 12mg of subutex. I abused it, tried for over a year to taper and quit the ""right"" way, but after relapse after relapse I gave up. Eventually when Covid hit and I was out of work for the foreseeable future I decided to make the jump. I used red Kratom to aid my withdrawals, that was it. I know people have mixed feelings about the stuff, but personally it saved my life. It's the only reason I'm clean today and was able to make it through the hell of jumping from 12mg of sub (16 a week before).

    This survey has been approved by the moderators.      

Hi everyone,

I am Melvin Goh, a PhD student from the University of Wollongong, Australia. My PhD research focuses on improving the health and well-being of people impacted by alcohol and other drugs via health risk communication.

I am conducting a study to survey people living in Australia and the United States of America (USA) about their alcohol and other drug use, health and well-being, health behaviours, and the impact of COVID-19 (UOW Ethics Approval No. 2019/183).

**What’s involved?**

You are invited to complete an anonymous online survey about your use of a range of substances, health and well-being, health behaviours, and COVID-19. The survey may take up to 20 minutes, although some people may complete it faster. Please be assured that your responses will be kept strictly ANONYMOUS as the survey does not ask of any personal identifiable details from you!

**To be eligible to participate, you will need to:**

* Be aged 18 and above living in Australia or the USA;
* Have had problems with illicit drugs or alcohol and/or have attended alcohol or other drugs (AOD) treatment in the past 12 months.

Please visit [https://uow.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_dm1oXM1GmqDEJQV](https://uow.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dm1oXM1GmqDEJQV) to participate or to get more information on the survey.

Eligible participants who complete the entire survey can enter a prize draw to win one of five $50 Amazon gift cards (currency based on location). I understand that a lucky draw for a gift card isn't the most attractive incentive, but I hope you can understand that it is the most I can get as a student. More importantly, it will help me with the PhD and achieve my aim of improving the health and well-being of people impacted by alcohol and/or other drugs.

If you have any questions, please let me know. Thank you to everyone who took the time to read my post and complete my survey :)",['OTH'],0,0,0,0,0,1

Been on subs for 2 weeks. Actually think it’s not the best/right treatment for me (not cause of side effects ) I feel I’m actually not heavily addicted to opioids. While taking subs too it did make me feel a little not depressed but I got used to it. (Not heavily addicted I don’t feel withdrawl, subs are not for me). 

I do addiction counseling and have anxiety I get benzodiazepine for that. (Not trying to lose my prescription)

I had some terrible news, my vacation got canceled.

**& now I just want to know I stopped suboxone 8mg / 2mg 48 hrs ago or 2 days /nights ago...**

**How long would it take to feel a reasonable dose of oxycodone or any opioid**

**EDIT: 36 hrs is just the half life for HALF the dose to be eliminated, also wish it was subutex instead of suboxone. Naloxone makes a difference. I just don’t want to take a OC and feel nothing and get more upset, wish there was a way to check if it would effect me.**

Also, I occasionally take like 15mg(not very heavy) for discomfort. It’s long story why I had to be on subs 2 weeks ago.

First week I allowed myself dab pens, which I don’t usually allow myself cuz I get addicted to them easy and I manage better with only flower. Funny how I’m still an addict in that way 😅 I stopped the carts in week two and I have not been able to get a high at all from weed (flower). I do get dependent on carts easy tho, and I’ve even withdrawn from them in the past when stopping. I’m hoping it’s just cuz of the cart and in a few days I’ll be able to get high from weed(flower)again! Lol. I’m learning this lesson for the 2nd or 3rd time being clean. At one point in my first year of clean time, I had like a 1-1.5 month bender per say with buying a new cart every single day, spending 40+$ every day for a lil over a month! They are not to be played with, and that’s why I don’t buy them usually! But I let myself for the sub wd. Bad idea, I know just how much I’m affected by them. I feel like non addicts who use concentrates don’t have the same problems if these use pens everyday...but my first addiction was dabbing so not sure. 

Anyone have any info on if it’s just cuz of going hard on like 2g of carts in a week and then going back to flower? Usually I can still feel it a lil after using a cart for a week or so but not this time around. I also haven’t used a cart in months cuz I’ve been really good about not giving in to the desire. The pens makes me a straight zombie anyways. I pretty much nod off when using them all day. I was addicted to dabbing before dope! I really wanna be able to feel the relaxation of weed again! Maybe in a few days it’ll come back I’m assuming. I feel dumb for using the carts, just created another problem. That’s why I only smoke flower, cuz carts give me issues.

877,jubgki,"New to suboxone, fairly happy with results, but afraid results will fade and side effects will be all that remains.. I have a degenerative disease of the spine, had a couple of surgeries, been through numerous procedures, and have taken every non-opiate med on the market to try in an effort to have a somewhat normal life. But, nothing has worked and I have had an 8 year migraine- no breaks. A good day is a level 7 headache and this doesn't include my neck and back issues.

I have used Norco and Percocet for short periods immediately after my surgeries,  but never for more than a few weeks, so I've never developed an addiction. I've grown tired of the pain and told my doctor I need a real pain medicine or I'm going to give up (permanently).

This week I was started on Suboxone. For the first time in 8 years I've woken up without a migraine, which is awesome. But, I've also felt like I was back in college and was on the tail end of fifth of vodka the last bowl of the night. In other words, I feel awesome, but at any second I'm going to nod off and it lasts the entire day.

After 8 years, I much prefer this new feeling to the latter.  But, I'm not looking to feel high. I just want to function and be relatively free of pain.  My question is, will my body adapt to where I can be alert while still getting the pain relief? Or, does the pain relief and euphoria go hand in hand  and both will dissappear?

I talked to my doc, they're having trouble getting me a medication that works for headaches that my insurance will cover and that won't interfere with the subs and my constant low blood pressure. But I really just think it's a side effect of my insanely high dose of subs. I take 2 8/2 mg pills a day. Nothing to complain about except headaches and (duh) constipation. I asked to lower my dose, docs said no. I've cut it on my own to 1.5 8/2s a day, so I'm at 12 instead of 16 mg, but I still get the headaches. They're indescribable, a million times worse than my old migraines (which I thought were unbearable at the time.) I vomit every time I try to move from the pain in my head if I don't have the right dose of the right medicine. I have a toddler and 2 jobs, I can't keep doing this.

I read a lot about the Bernese method, but nothing along the lines of a guide. I figure it would probably be best to start it off in withdrawal. Last time I gave myself roughly 48 hours of no fentanyl, but that was a baaaaad idea. Precipitated withdrawal was a bitch. At that time I was able to last about two days after taking the sub but of course my dealer texted me that night asking if I was good and I didn’t have the strength to say no. 

So my plan is give myself 72 hours of detox. Usually I’m sick as a dog well before that but I’m gonna really try hard to make it to the 72nd hour.

So I take the .5 and just wallow in my misery for however king but then before work take a small amount of fentanyl to keep my from being too sick. This is where I get kinda lost. So at that 3 day mark do I just taper down the fent while tapering up the bupe so I’m at 8mg of dupe within 5-8 days and no fent by the end?

Thanks for any advice guys. I do appreciate y’all’s help.","['MA', 'CDU', 'PPE']",0,1,1,1,0,0

903,hs8vlo,"I am thinking about jumping off Subutex and have some kratom questions.... So I tried to taper my Subutex and it just isn’t working for me anymore. I got down to 1mg but after a month of hell I’m back up to 1.75-2mg so I decided I need to jump and get it done. I’ve heard the red strain of kratom called Maeng da is great for jumping off Subs. So anyways, I have a few questions about it and kratom in general. 

1. Where should I buy it from? There are headshops in my area that sell it but is it going to be high quality or even work? 

2. I can’t take kratom unless it’s in capsules (the taste makes me instantly vomit) so I will need to buy those as well and I’m wondering how many capsules to take and when to take them? 

3. I DO NOT want or need another addiction so how long can I safely take kratom without becoming dependent/addicted? 

4. I have horrible anxiety so I definitely want a strain that keeps me calm, are there any other strains you recommend?

I came out on 16mg a day, then went down to 12mg, and now I’m at 8mg a day sometimes 10mg depending on the day (films not pills). Suboxone is a great drug for certain people but the effects it’s having on me isn’t too great. The last few months I’ve been experience side effects like increase in depression. Like most people, when I take my dose (4mg in the morning, 4mg in the evening, and some days 2mg in the middle of the day), I get a boost in energy and ready for whatever. However as the months have went on I’m constantly clock watching and planning my daily tasks on when I take my next dose so I have the energy to accomplish them. When I was on 16mg a day, I never ran into this issue because I would just take 4mg constantly throughout the day and be ready for whatever. I also have some issues with my thyroid so I know at least part of my issues are because of that but I just feel like the Suboxone is also a issue. I never had a big problem until I dropped to 8mg a day and that was about 5 months ago now. I’ve been on Suboxone total for just over a year. 

So that brings me to my question just wanted to give a little background first. I thankfully am lucky enough have the option to go into a detox center next month. However the doctor told me it would just be a 6-10 day detox depending on how I’m doing. That doesn’t make sense to me. I’ve read that even though your brain might think different, Buprenorphine will last up to 72 hours after last dose. I’ve also read that withdrawal/detox  from Buprenorphine is worse than withdrawal/detox from regular opiates like oxy and heroin. And I’ve heard not only is it worse but takes longer as well to detox. So if I take my normal dose the day prior to going into detox, and the effects can last 72 hours, how the hell am I going to be okay with just 7 days at max left in detox? This will be my fourth treatment center in my life so I get it…I know it’s not supposed to be comfortable or easy, but if these withdrawals are worse than opiates and last longer, I have no idea how 7 days will help me at all. Does anyone have experience, advice, or been through anything like this? If so I would greatly appreciate it.

I do better with buprenorphine pain wise I tried belbuca in the past but it was too weak and could only be taken twice a day plus it’s ungodly expensive. 

So I decided to see a pain management physician who’s an anesthesiologist and also an addiction doctor. I do this because my current pain doc bless his heart is great but I have a lot of issues: he can’t prescribe suboxone or at least doesn’t wanna get in trouble, drug tests almost every month that cost around $250 each which is excessive for how model of a patient I am, and the 40 minute drive which is brutal in pain. 

It’s about $70 for bupe pills vs like $250 for suboxone genetic too for a months supply. Bad insurance and all that. Name brand suboxone isn’t even coveted under my plan and I see no need to cash pay for it I have too many medical expenses due to my chronic pain. 

So the logical choice is the buprenorphine pills aka subutex. I wonder is it as well absorbed under the tongue as subs? Can they be cut into 4ths and have an equal portion in each (I want to start very low and keep the dose to a point where I’m sober but in a lot less pain, not too energetic or naucus). 

TLDR: bupe pills (subutex) can I cut in 4ths? Is it as strong as suboxone? Suboxone vs bupe pills worth paying 3-4 times as much for generic suboxone? Why does every one sat generic suboxone sucks isn’t it the same amount of buprenorphine in it?","['MA', 'AL']",1,1,0,0,0,0

But I have a couple of vicodin 500 I was thinking about taking. Also, i have a half of a suboxone pill I was thinking about taking maybe later tonight or early this morning. Just to see if I am going to be ok or perhaps get the PW's over with earlier since I have to work tomorrow. 

You think I will be ok taking the vics now, and taking subs about 18 hours later? Or do you think I should try taking the half of sub I have later on tonight? I am a big baby about withdrawls and I cant wait until tomorrow to start feeling better since I have a lot of things I need to do today. Thanks.","['CDU', 'MA', 'PPE']",0,1,1,1,0,0

I take a generic pill form as I’m no longer able to afford brand name suboxone but it’s just as good, except for it takes longer to dissolve and tastes worse. Anyways I struggle with chronic pain, bipolar disorder, anxiety and addiction. I started with oxy for the pain and soon got hooked on it so I tried switching to kratom which I took at least an ounce of every day and it f’ed me up and made me miserable, I started relapsing on dope and I almost died a couple times because I relapsed so hard. I finally got in touch with a doctor and I’m happy to say that not only am I sober, but I also need less medication for my depression/bipolar and even able to take less klonopin.

941,8o2ih1,"One month on subs, questions about relapse. Hey guys so I started on subs about a month ago after about a year and a half of opiate use that started with 15mg oxys and ended up with 14-20 bags a day of what I’m pretty sure was fentanyl or a fent analog, it was defiantly much stronger then normal heroin and I snorted never shot.  This stuff was so strong that I actually had to wait 55 hours until I was sick enough to induce subs and even then I think I was only about a 10 to 12 max on the COWS scale.  I started on 16mg for the first couple days then dropped to 12 and then 8 and I’m fine on 8 most days but some days I’ll still take 12 but I feel like I could be fine on even less then 8 sometimes however I do get some cravings sometimes when I go down to 8.  The next part I probably shouldn’t be considering and maybe I’m just looking to be talked out of it but I’m wondering what the consequences of one days of use would look like.  At this point I haven’t taken a sub in 24 hours and feel fine what would happen if I used 3-5 bags once today and that was it?  Even if I did get somewhat high I would then have to wait until I was in mild to moderate withdrawal after using the dope to be able to successfully get back on the subs right ?  That would happen after using a short acting opiate even just once right? Would it likely take almost 55 hours again for that to happen?  I’ve heard it’s harder to get back on subs everytime after a relapse and I know it’s a bad idea and I’m probably just gonna force myself to take a sub soon so I’ll stop thinking about it but I’m curious if anyone has experience getting high just once while on suboxonetreatment, esp if it’s a short acting opiate with a long half life like fent.

I know subs are no silver bullet though and the reason I am posting here is to ask everyone's opinion on them being prescribed for only kratom addiction.

Do you feel that prescribing subs for kratom to be an overreaction? I've used and abused kratom myself for years but it didn't drive me to subs. It was a combination of depression and easy access to fent and 2 overdoses that did it. I've just noticed there's a few people around here who are on subs just because of kratom and honestly it is a little surprising to me.

I am 3 and a half weeks sober but I’m still having the WORST body temperature regulation with cold chills/hot flashes/general flushing. It is primarily located on my face, arms, and stomach area. The rest of my body seems fine. I went through the horrid withdrawal to find that the biggest symptom still persists.

I went to a Suboxone doctor initially to get clean which had helped but he will no longer prescribe me it for some reason. Clonidine has not helped either and I am wondering if I should go to my regular doctor at this point or go to the emergency room? I went to the ER before and they did nothing so I am unsure of what to do. Should I see another Suboxone doctor (psychiatrist) or look at rehab options?

So day 8, the hardest is still adjusting and dealing with insomnia, as well as off and on upset stomach. Can't eat meat yet, lots of oatmeal, bananas, yougurt, protein bars and vitamins. I went 4 nights of 2-3hrs of sleep. It's a response of fight or flight in early withdrawals, but today I felt a bit better. I do get pretty achey and exhausted doing too much.

All in all things seem to be getting better on day 8, with lingering symptoms. I def could not work with the meds, sensitive stomach and insomnia though. I'd be pretty sore and miserable on me. 

At this point if I can get the insomnia straight and sleep a full 6-7 hrs a night. I think I could deal and push myself back into jogging and full meals.

1st success after a few days, was back at work day 9. 

2nd no way- drove me to insanity and was dumb years ago and failed 12 days in. 

On my 3rd time 10 days in today.

10 years prescribed to me, first detox got in when it was very controlled like a few months, taper and no more. Very clinical and strict. Eventually it morphed into, you put big cash upwards of $300 and walk out with 6 months huge script. But its like anything else and I believe our responsibility to choose what we buy and put in our bodies. So withdrawl situations vary greatly, based on doctor, history and length on. 

So today, I slept about 4 1/2 hrs going on a week, of two sleep cycles with stomach pains upon waking up. My brain is still sorting it out, but my body just is run down from lack of real sleep. It's very mental but in a physical rebuilding way. Hurts my bones, but what I'm doing...

I'm just letting it be. I'm on medicinal cannabis a lot, it's the only way things feel ok without crying sometimes from how taxing this is, or just going to a bad place. I stay away from prescribed benzos during day light hours. I just have to remember 10 days is a great achievement, but it's still pretty early. 

I'm just so lucky, I have 3 more weeks of no responsibilities to try and get this checked and then go on a vacation.

In this process, the focus has to be on you. You don't know how you will feel each day. So plans, call backs be damned. Some days you will be able to follow through with everything. You need to get into a good mind space and just ride it out. Avoid stress, negativity, and distract yourself when you get anxious energy, rest when not feeling well, treat your symptoms as you are your own doctor through this.

979,9hb342,"HELP!! Subutex dosing questions!!. Hey, so I recently got into subutex after a pretty bad pill habit. 100mg of oxy would keep me normal and wasn’t getting me high anymore, so I knew it was time for me to quit. I’ve been prescribed suboxone before but this is the first time I’ve been on subutex and I have to say it’s the best decision I’ve ever made in my life. 

For starters, my depression is almost nonexistent. This is something I’ve struggled with my entire life , even before my pill problem and I’ve tried SO MANY types of Anti depressants and medicines so far nothing comes even close to what subutex can do for me. With that though, comes a few concerns. When I was on suboxone it didn’t do A SINGLE thing for my depression, in fact, I want to say it almost made it worse. Is this somethings that’s common? 

And my most important questions are for my dosage. I’m on 8mg right now and I’ve felt it enhance my mood, energy, and I just get this sense of a better quality of life I’ve never had before, but some days not so much anymore. Before it was 100%, but now it’s 5-6/7 days it works fine but recently I would take my daily dose and would find I felt nothing one or two days out of the week. Granted, I wasn’t sick and going through WD, but I still miss the bliss that comes with my subs. I know everyones brain chemistry is different but I almost feel like these were made to keep me sane ITs come to the point if you had a roxy in one hand and a sub in the other, I’d take the sub. 

I tried to go up to 12 mg and see what that does for me but as far as I can tell it felt exactly the same as 8mg. I want to try 16 but I know that subs have a ceiling effect and don’t want to be wasting my stash when I could be saving it for a rainy day. I take my dose basically in 24 hour increments and just pop the entire tablet under my tounge and let it sit there for 30 mins. If I feel okay I’ll add another 12 hours before I take my medicine and it’ll usually hit me a little stronger. I’ve heard after a while Youre not going to feel anything from the subs and that’s scaring me bcs saying that this pill is a life saver is an understatement and it would be my nightmare if it didn’t give me the boost it does now.

We are having a baby in 3 weeks and he says I don't have any right to be upset that he's still using because it ""doesn't effect him anymore"" but hundreds of dollars a week are going missing and I can't imagine he would keep buying if it did absolutely nothing.

You take the pill four times a day for a week, when you're detoxing off opioids. The max you should use it is 14 days.  You can take it along with subs, methadone, or vivitrol / naltrexone.

I’ve been on suboxone on and off the past two years but didn’t really take getting sober completely until the beginning of this year. I started at 8mg of the generic pill and started tapering down last 2 months. Around that time I started getting some really bad symptoms like a persistent low grade fever and bouts of feeling faint which really scared me because a few times I thought I might pass out at work. I didn’t immediately attribute it to the taper because as I mention I’d been on subs before and never had a problem. I went and saw a doctor and got bloodwork done and everything seemed okay. The faint feeling has subsided but now I get headaches almost everyday and have lost a lot of motivation almost in a state of depression constantly. I’m currently down to 5-6mg a day but people I talk to say that it’s less to do with the taper and more that I’m having an adverse reaction to the generic subs.

1001,9tdncb,"Interesting tidbit I had missed on Sublocade...and any experiences with people stopping after 100mg dose?. So, I had been doing a bunch of research and was interested in sublocade. I must be one of the lucky ones, because I asked my Dr less than 3 weeks ago and their office already has the medication there and ready for me.

That said, I've been pretty excited to go in about 2 weeks for my injection. My only reservation/concern was actually that the 300mg might be TOO HIGH of a dose for me. I know I could be easily stable around ~4mg/day, and currently trying more around ~8mg...but I think starting the sublocade might be more like 16, and all day long.

Seems as though some of the blood plasma concentrations support that too, where average & low are close, but on high side some people have DOUBLE the bupe in their blood on sublocade vs 12mg subutex (and still significantly more than 24mg subutex).

This does not seem to bode well for tapering down.  But then I found this:

> **“After steady-state has been achieved (4-6 months), patients discontinuing SUBLOCADE may have detectable plasma levels of buprenorphine for twelve months or longer. “**

Wait, so...after I drop to the 100mg dose, if lets say after this initial 6 month approval is up I decide I want to come off...

I'm wondering if this means it may be possible to quit and allow the sublocade to slowly lower your blood plasma (because the depot doesn't fully dissolve in 30 days, more like 60 so I think you're still getting residual from previous months). 

Also the fact the say it will be detectable in plasma for TWELVE MONTHS or longer makes me especially question whether maybe these depots continue releasing a significantly lower dose for a much longer period than actually advertised.

So far, I've only found 1 person who had claimed to stopped--they were about 60 days post last 100mg shot and said they felt great. I wonder if withdrawal would still come, though. Or maybe the plasma reduces so slowly with this method that it makes coming off easy?

I don't know, and I think it probably needs to be studied significantly more.

TL;DR - Invidor says “After steady-state has been achieved (4-6 months), patients discontinuing SUBLOCADE may have detectable plasma levels of buprenorphine for twelve months or longer. “

WTF does that mean? How is it a depot that is supposedly releasing 30 days of meds going to still be in my blood a year later?","['TP', 'MA', 'PPE']",0,1,1,0,1,0

I should also mention I'm on other meds that make it hard for me to lower my dose because it will increase the side effects of those drugs (Vyvanse,  seroquel).

Day after day he reminds me I’m just a disgrace. Not like he says, “meghan, you’re doing good. You’re almost there just keep at it” about my tapering. My dad got upset over things I said to him the other day with and we hung up on bad terms. 

I hate talking badly about suboxone but when you’re not meant to be on it, it sucks so much. Tapering slowly is not easy but to be successful it needs to happen. The last 4 years have been so bad for me. I don’t have a life. When people ask what I do for fun... I am glued to my phone. That’s it. I can’t stop crying. My chest is tight. I hate my life. I’m not happy. I have one dead brother and one who is so mean to me. I wish I had facts about suboxone to throw at him when he comes after me but I just don’t. And it wouldn’t matter anyway. I just needed to vent. I’m just so sad. I know he has Reddit and I sure hope he doesn’t go into this suboxone subreddit.  

Edit: here is my story about me getting on suboxone and what happened:

I have a very bad lower back. My old primary doctor put me on Vicoprofen 7.5mg for my pain. I had tons of scans done of my back and nothing ever showed up. My brother died on April 26, 2014. It was very traumatic. I now do have PTSD from it. He had schizophrenia. He abused drugs and alcohol. But he was suffering and every day was a waiting game did the day he’d end up dying. I had also been dumped 8 months prior to him dying by my first love after being together for 2 years and living together for 1. I actually went from 136lbs to 103lbs in 6 months after I was dumped because I just couldn’t eat. It was pretty bad. So being miserable, I took Vicoprofen than I should have. The max is take was 8 in a 15 hour period. But it was not all the time and it was not for a long time. Because addiction was in the family, I saw what I was doing. I told my primary and she had said she was giving me less because she saw me starting to do it too. She said to me, ""there's a medicine called suboxone. I don't know that much about it but it helps with withdrawal"". So me being afraid and aware of what was going on, I made an appointment with a psychiatrist I'd seen before and she threw me on 2mg of suboxone. I went in blindly. I had ZERO idea what suboxone was. 4 years later and now I'm finally down to 0.28mg. I am doing a very very slow taper. I got addicted to suboxone but I was not a full addict yet before being put on it.","['TP', 'PPE']",0,0,1,0,1,0
1008,9ydkra,"Paws experienced for those off. So I'm just trying to find some info on this. I'm going to see my doctor tomorrow afternoon and I'm out of work temporary for another week. I'm almost at 5 months clean after 10 years on sub. Around day 70 my sleep rhythm kicked back in and I was sleeping great, waking up early, rested and ready to go. I was very proud the only thing I took was 0.5- 1mg klonipin hour before bed.

 But about a week ago I started waking up at 2-3am with the dreaded adrenaline rushes most know of during acute that screw with sleep and your head. Well I was told to increase my klonipin and that didn't even work. So now I'm backing down off the klonipin after a week of 2-3mg from the episode that went on for about a week. 

I walked out of work and to a leave of absence due to it catching up to me and my boss not happy with me 3hrs sleep, a bit irritable from the klonipin as well. So I just left last Sunday morning and says I may need to take a leave. My doc gave me antidepressants and I tried for a few days. It made my symptoms worse and created more so I stoped. 

So im at a confusing crossroads. I don't feel I'm depressed. Yes I do have anxiety at times especially late at night but it was getting better and then suddenly got bad. I'm not sure if adding more meds is the answer and that it's possibly a PAWS related episode triggered possibly by job stress with unrealistic expectations at times, randomness and also finding a suboxone and almost relapsing shortly before all this took place.

I used to take suboxone as prescribed a few years ago and went cold turkey off 2mgs a day after 2 years of taking it so I know how long and drawn out the withdrawal can be. 

My situation now is I usually take hydros for 2 separate pain conditions, but due to shitty circumstances in a bad relationship I haven't been able to get back to my doctor for refills and 4 weeks ago began taking some suboxone I had stashed away for pain here and there. 

I never took more than 2mg a day and would space 2 or 3 days between doses so I wouldn't get addicted. Well, somehow I became physically dependant again and I've been kicking them for 8 days now. 

Yesterday, day 7 I felt great besides some chills and thought I was in the clear, but today I'm back to feeling icky and cold sweats. Did I really fuck myself from 3 weeks of irregular use??! 

My second question is, would I fuck myself even more if I took a small (1mg or less)  dose to help me get through a day tomorrow?

I  have been a sober over one year now but I have been in AA working the steps therapy once a week,  I became a certified personal trainer I have made many accomplishments more than I ever have in my entire life but now I feel I'm ready to come off I feel like I'm a 60% of a person if that makes any sense, compared to being sober without anything, I feel as if I'm in a fog on suboxone.  Also blood work shows that it did lower my testosterone a great amount and my estrogen doubles unfortunately went up so they are fixing that as well. I have used subs as a tool, not as something relying to keep me sober. I tapered as followed from when i started to now:
Month 1-6 @16mg ( This is way too much and I do not recommend it)
Month 7-12 @8mg
Over the past 2 weeks I rapidly tapered
Week 1 was @4mg
Then 3..2.. and I jumped

 Today I feel just general withdraw symptoms but no cravings, hot and cold hallucinations at night,  I've watched TV all day today and yesterday. My sponsor has checked on me I have a good support system. I've been through withdraw from about everything oxy heroin and so far the subs are not that bad but we shall see even with those drugs, my withdraws never lasted more than a few days I've always been in good shape and have a fast metabolism which I'm sure helps

I had been stable at 2 mg for about a year. Over the past 3 weeks, I’ve gone from 2 mg to 0 mg. On my second day at 0, I made the mistake of buying a bundle. I shot 3 bags the first day (two days ago) and 6 bags yesterday. The first day I got high, felt great. Yesterday, nothing. Felt like shit. Felt More like an upper coke or something shitty than heroin. I assume no fentanyl because I was somehow okay despite years of no use and no tolerance. Today, I am on nothing. No heroin, no subs. Feel like shit. Have taken a few Benadryl to help sleep and for the flu like symptoms - I am sneezing, tearing, cold sweats. I don’t want to go back on subs , the sub withdrawl felt way worse - like my legs were going to die and like I might have a heart attack — but am not sure what to do now.

For some background I did a very long taper, down to miniscule amounts, and it was much easier than I expected. I had the added benefit of moving to a location where I didn't know anyone, with very few sub doctors, so I was able to hoard up enough subs to do a long taper and now I am good. Last dose was 0.015 mg, 2 weeks ago.

Unfortunately over the past 8 weeks I have gained almost 30 lbs. Quitting smoking and switching to juice and iced tea instead of diet soda, as well as switching to another daily energy drink that has high calories, have all been part of the reason why. Weight gain isn't even the problem though, I know how to fix that. The problem is this itchy / scratchy / dry feeling in my throat that I have damn near constantly.

Doctor thinks it is acid reflux since I am also coughing when laying down and because I don't have any signs of an illness. He also said rapid weight gain can also cause reflux. But the meds I have been taking for 3 days are not helping this feeling in my throat.

So far, though, things haven’t been as difficult as I’d imagined them to be as this point. I hope I don’t regret saying that this time tomorrow, but I’m hoping I can go to work on day 5. I have some left for if it’s unbearable, but I’m hoping I can stay focused and just look at my time tracker when I feel weak. 

This may not work for everyone, but it’s a lot harder to talk myself into taking something when I see I’m less than 6 hours away from 4 days. That will be the longest period I’ve gone without taking some form of opiate in six years, and that’s monumental to me. I read a post from someone in this forum that compared withdrawal to paying a debt, and I really like that. I think addicts grow accustomed to the roller coaster of high highs and extreme lows, and I know I expect the worst when I start to feel withdrawal symptoms.

Marijuana has been helping with this, as it feels like a light buffer and a distraction, and it has helped with getting to sleep—but only for 2-3 hours. Even though I haven’t felt like it at all, I have gotten out and socialized, ran errands, and worked around the house. It’s better for me to keep busy and focus on a task or a conversation. 

I know that some light exercise would be undoubtedly beneficial, but I just can’t bring myself to do anything of the sort so far. The biggest physical symptom I’ve noticed is hot/cold sensitivity, and with it being extremely cold outside, convincing myself to get out hasn’t been an easy task, but I’m dealing. From what I’ve read throughout my taper, things may get worse over the next few days. I hope not, but I feel prepared for it right now.

1030,akjg5h,"Is it ""okay"" to stay on Suboxone?. Hello

I have been taking Suboxone since 2013. July 4th of that year was the last time I used the hard stuff, and the Sub has really helped me these past years.

At the moment, I am on 2mg per day. I've tried to ween off of it at least 10 times, but whenever I get down under 1mg or so, it's very rough. I can never find the 2 months or so needed to feel like shit and just get it out of my system.

The thing is - this small dose of Sub has been the only thing that works for my depression. I suffered severe depression from around 17 all the way up until I started taking Sub. I had tried 7 antidepressants throughout those years, none of them doing anything.

Also, my family doctor is fine keeping me on this dose, and says that he has a few patients that just live on it. The thing is, I can't tell if that is the pharmaceutical kickback talking. 

Anyway, is there anything wrong with living on 2mg of Sub per day? I have no major side effects, other than feeling a little groggy toward the end of the day. I live an otherwise healthy life, though I am pretty introverted. I think I am just introverted by nature though, not because of the Sub.

 I've been on suboxone for 2 1/2 years. I started on moderate dose then my Dr upped me to help with longterm pain. Its been a godsend with pain.  I'd never tried street drugs, just prescribed narcotics which got out of hand as I kept trying to cover up pain. **I was on MS Contin (extended release morphine for 8+ years & dabbled in other prescription narcotics when my dose wasn't enough so total of about 20 years of constant use)**
But my Dr retired & new Dr wants me back to ""standard dose"". He dropped me 8mg within 30 days and I feel almost on verge of constant withdrawal. I don't know if its my mind playing tricks on me or the actual decrease. 
Has anyone tried using Kratom as pain relief while on suboxone? Is it safe?  I bought some at our local ""vape shop"" to try. The pain is unbearable tonight. 
PS: I am very open with my Dr and will tell him about the issues I'm having, but just trying to get thru the weekend and my next appt is Wednesday. I'm def not looking for a high, just relief. ","['CDU', 'PPE']",0,0,1,1,0,0

1039,apjoiw,"Running Out Early Question. Hi everyone, I have a question for the community and hope to find a good answer. 

I've been on suboxone (10mg total daily) for 6 months now without a hitch. It's helped me to stop using any illicit drugs completely and I haven't encountered any problems thus far. 

I was switched to 2-week prescriptions recently and this is where the problems started. I have Hep C, but have not had any treatment as my body has been fighting it off on its own. I am scheduled for another blood test soon to see where my levels are, but they've been so low that treatment is not recommended. 

The one symptom of Hep C that kills me is the joint aches. It feels like opioid withdrawal (restless legs/arms) and wakes me up in the middle of the night often. I can't stand it. This has led me to taking an extra strip (often cutting smaller pieces) from time to time to relieve the pain. I know, terrible choice. 

I'm now out of subs and have several days before my refill. I've been doing well and my doctor has been praising me, but now I am sick and feel like a failure/drug seeker. 

Should I call their office and be honest about my situation, or should I just try to hold out until the end of the week? Since this is my first problem, I think my doctor would be empathetic, but I'm pretty scared to come clean. 

I am going to ask to switch back to weekly appointments and ask my partner to hold onto my prescription but for the time being, what should I do? 

TIA

So I guess my question really is:

Do most doctors use confirmation testing?

Is there anything I can do to help myself relax about this?

I have been using a prescription mouthwash called 'PerioGard' due to a tooth infection for the past week. If my doctor does use confirmation testing would it be possible to slip this in my visit as a possible reason for having a low count?

Thanks for anyway that can help

edit: I assume just relaxing and knowing that my test will come back positive should be good enough. My doctor actually specializes in infectious diseases like hepatitis and HIV, but he's the only doctor at my health facility with a license to prescribe suboxone (I'm native american) so I think since I am reading a lot into it and it's not a true blue pain clinic I should be OK for the most part.

I have actually had some med changes since then (trazadone instead of diazepam which sucks, omeprazole, and the mouthwash) So I probably have some decent excuses not to feel good to begin with.

1058,iqlulw,"Suboxone, Opioids and Benzos. Hey y’all,

I’ve currently been on 120mls of methadone for several years and I’m contemplating switching over to suboxone. Main reason being I can still use AND get high while on methadone, which makes it harder to say no and get completely clean. My understanding is that suboxone completely blocks your receptors to opioids, which makes using basically pointless, and could be another helper/benefit to getting of the dope, as opioids are my main DOC (Drug Of Choice). My question is.. I know using heroin, Fentanyl, oxy, and things likes percocets have 0 affect while on suboxone. I’m wondering is it the same for Benzodiazepines? I deal with social anxiety and occasionally I need an Ativan, diazepam or Xanax. Would those have 0 affect while on suboxone as well? Or is it different for Benzos appose to the opioids while on subs. I’m very aware of the risks involved in combining Benzos with methadone, I’ve done it many times before in the past, but I don’t know how the process goes if I chose to switch to Suboxone.

Abused oxy for 2.5 years, started with small amounts but towards the end of it was using 200-300 mg most days. Then got on subs for 4 months. Tapered from 8 mg to 0.5ish. I felt good starting subs, and the taper was easy enough for the first couple months. Then the last month, under 1mg, I found myself hating the negative side effects and was just ready to be sober. I read so so so much about the withdrawals and stuff that I was really scared to jump. But at the same time I was just always in a bad mood, no energy, sex drive, feelings. I couldn't take being on subs anymore. So I got my affairs in order, told my dr, took a week off work, went out of town so I wasn't tempted and just fucking jumped. 

the jump &amp; honeymoon phase~

The first few days following my jump, I constantly felt like it was right about hit me. That at any moment the real opiate wds were about to start. Body temp regulation was a bit off, mild RLS at night, insomnia - but nothing terrible at this point. After another few days of laziness I realized it wasn't going to fuck my shit up like I thought it would. In fact, I started feeling better!.  Got goosebumps from books, vibed to music, and cried from movies. Reached out to old friends I hadn't talked to in a while. My appetite came back with a vengeance. FOOD IS SO GOOD AGAIN. Suffer knowing the end is near and life will be soso much improved should help get through the tough parts. I ate like a beast. I can concentrate on things relatively easy. Sex is sex again.

~paws~

The mild withdrawals lasted about a week. Despite them I felt damn good having feelings and energy again even without getting much sleep. Then that chapter ended and a new one began. This one was different, I felt no physical withdrawals but the mental component was a struggle. Depression, lethargy, a bit anxiety - but still better than when I was on 0.5g subs. This was worst around day 10. However day by day, I began slowly building myself back up. Starting running, and noticed I felt much better after doing exercise. Kept eating healthy and taking care of my body. Kept staying busy with books and movies. Each day has been better and better. I'm now at day 23 and feel more like my old self than ever before. Still struggling a bit with sleep and energy but overall feel good and proud of myself for NOT being dependent on any god damn substance or medicine to feel okay for the first time in years. Totally worth it

Then I thought maybe it could be the buprenorphine? Is it possible that I would need a dose adjustment or this is just a normal side effect? I've been experiencing more pain than usual, but I've been taking additional gabapentin to deal with it (which I'm also prescribed) (Ideally I would prefer to not be on Belbuca or be on a lower dose but my pain is 10/10 horrible without it) I don't have any other of my typical telltale withdrawal symptoms such as yawning and tachycardia.

The first day after the shot I was quite intoxicated and sleepy, which I posted about, but I later deleted my post because I didn't want to scare people. I had also taken a Sudafed that morning which I believe messed me  up more than normal. Slept like a log this night.

Days 2-3: feeling kind of ""flat,"" a bit tired and forgetful. almost intermittently in some kind of w/d's. Wondering if this could be from the naloxone leaving my body. Good riddance! Didn't sleep well either night. 

Days 4-5 - energy rising, I'm starting to feel better. I'm proud that I haven't needed to supplement with any films and it is SUCH a great feeling to not have to pop those nasty films in my mouth twice a day. My energy feels more stable and I slept very well last night. 

Regarding the injection - the needle itself did not hurt but right after she injected me it burned like hell for about 5 seconds. And then burned intermittently a few more times that day, each time with less intensity. My injection site is still bruised and somewhat swollen.

1080,r88t7v,"Question about tapering off subs.. If you don't want to read the backstory and just wanna see my question go to paragraph 2 please.

I'll start off by saying I didn't start taking subs till after being clean. I got on them because I had/have major health issues that involved 8 surgeries in 6 months and am left a life long condition that causes constant pain and discomfort. So instead of taking personal or oxys for pain management my doctor said suboxone with other non narcotic pain killers would work. But now I feel like my condition has got to the point where non narcotic pain killers can keep my quality of life pretty good. They prescribed me 2 8mg strips a day but I was still in a lot of pain so I went to 3 a day. Over the last few months I've gone down to 1.5 strips a day. I've also relocated to a different state and getting subs in this state seems like it's gonna be a pain so fuck it. I'll take that as a sign.

So now that im on 1.5 8mg strips a day my question is I have about 50 8mg strips left and I would like some advice on the best way to taper down from here. I've gone down to 1 strip a day but I end up going back to 1.5 cause honestly my self control is shit. So if anyone out there can break down the best way to taper down to nothing I would really appreciate it. If possible I would like for it to end up where I taper real slow and end up with no strips left so I don't end up going back up.

I've been trying really hard to get off fentanyl so I had gotten on something called the safe supply. They subscribe you hydromorphone and doses are crazy and didn't help the fact that I was shooting it. So I recently went to my closest recovery clinic and asked about suboxone.
 I initially wanted 300 mg's of kadian (6 pm) (extended release morphine) so I got that for the first day. I felt okay in the first hour and then felt like shit so I popped a couple dillie 3 mg's (11 pm) to help and then took trazadone (11 pm) and by the time I woke up I felt great. 
The protocol was that I switch onto suboxone gradually taking 2 mg's until I reach 12 mg's. He told me to wait 24 hours after taking the Kadian and 12 hours after dilaudid until I touch the subs. I waited 25 hours before I touched the suboxone and took 6 mgs total until I was shot into insane precipitated withdrawals. I thought I waited long enough but I guess my body was taking longer to clear the morphine out of my system. Now it's been 6 hours and I feel like my symptoms are getting worse. I've got every symptom in the book x 50, and im not sure what to do. I'm not sure if I should stick another 2 mg of suboxone under my tongue or straight up take more dilaudid but I I'm pretty sure the dilaudid won't do shit because the suboxone is blocking those receptors right ? I know taking morphine wouldn't work on my goal of getting clean today but I'm calling my doctor tomorrow to work on the protocol.

First off, I'd like to preface this with if you do anything at all get off the Suboxone,or have them change your script don't let them give you more than you already have been taking which they will try and do. They will tell you all kinds of lies to make you think that it'll be okay and it isn't. FDA approved doesn't mean shit when you're at home waiting for your baby to be discharged a week later. 

I made the mistake of letting them convince me that the best thing for my baby and me was continuing my regiment. I wanted to quit the Suboxone or be given another type that wasn't as strong. They refused because they claim that the FDA states it's a safe drug and in their opinion changing anything would risk more than a possible withdrawal for the baby at birth. They also claim that they don't actually withdraw unless you're on an extremely high dose. That's also false. They do, it may not be methodone bad, but anything is bad enough.

The guilt that you feel, the way you are completely broken leaving the hospital without your child is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. The time that is stolen from you. I will never get those moments or days without my baby back. Someone else is holding them, feeding them, changing them.

At one point in time they were a lifesaver to stop the damage and cycle of addiction. Lately I’ve been stabilizing but here were some thoughts that have entered my mind on why I would like to eventually come off of them. 

* The other night I was just feeling “meh”. Not up , not down. I’m not used to not being able to manipulate my body to feel a certain way. Made me feel trapped. Kind of depressed. Then the next morning I woke up and went to work and was glad I was on them and couldn’t use. 

* What if I could just be off of them. Then I wouldn’t need to be on something every day. Then I remembered how I felt the other night and am convinced I would have used “something” to feel better.

* I miss the highs. How do I ever capture that overwhelming feeling of positivity, peace (at that moment) and sociable person. A life without highs? Fuck. 

* How am I supposed to deal with these social events coming up. I don’t know who I am without manipulating my personality before entering these situations. I feel helpless at times not being able to manipulate my feelings to cope with “x” scenario. 

* Where the fuck is my reward after a hard work day 

* I’m just normal on them. I’ve never been normal. How is this a good life to live ? Life seems to mundane. I can’t alter myself. This is strange. 

So these are reasons in my head (fleeting but I’m just being real) of why I can see myself getting off subs. Not to say I would go use again but on subs we are all kind of maxed out on what we can feel. I’m not used to that and haven’t been in over a decade.

So I got off suboxone at the beginning of the year but ended up having to get back on it because I went in in September to get my routine Vivitrol shot and the nurse decided (it was actually an accident) to hit my Sciatic nerve. Some of the worst pain of my life- was in the hospital for 6 days and out of work for 3 weeks. Nerves healing is a very, very painful and slow process and I was getting no sleep so I caved and got back on suboxone. Well, it’s a couple months later and I was feeling better so I figured it was time to get back off of them. I started at 6mg in October and almost immediately started tapering. When I got off I was taking 1mg a day for the previous two weeks or so. I took my last one on Saturday. I started taking kratom on Monday and I started out taking 5g in the morning and 5 at night (10gpd). The last two days I’ve been taking anywhere between 3-5G twice a day. I’m just wondering if I’m at any risk for getting kratom withdrawals? Or how long people would think I’d have to take kratom for the withdrawals to happen.

So for the past two weeks I have been experiencing headaches that have made me miss work, wake up crying and literally tried to knock myself out to get back to sleep. I don’t know if what I’m experiencing is cluster headaches or headaches from suboxone. I have been on it for 6-7 years. (1 1/2 of those I was in subutex.) I switched from subs to subutex because I was getting headaches but nothing like what I’m going through now. Due to my insurance I had to
Switch back to suboxone and have been taking it again since March of last year. 

I have always woke up 30 mins before my alarm goes off and dosing 3/4 and going back to sleep and I would take another 1/4 of a piece right before bed that night. But since I’ve been getting the headaches, I don’t even set my alarm because I know I’m gonna have a headache and waking up is seriously the most dreadful time of day for me. I have been taking my dose right before bed and that’s the only time I take it now. (3/4 or a 8mg strip.) has anyone else experienced this or have any advice for me? Is it due to me swallowing the Naloxone while I’m sleeping? Is it just because I’m doing it before bed? BCs and Advil and everything else doesn’t even touch these headaches.

1145,pl4i37,"Hard to Wrap My Head Around. I began MAT to assist with my stepping out of pain management with oxy/hydro after almost 11 years. As well, I needed to find a solution to address my chronic pain (Multiple Sclerosis/Broken Neck). 

I didn’t expect the pain relief to be as good as it is. My initial plan to stay in MAT for 90 days and then taper while searching out pain solutions. 

It’s now hitting home with me that Suboxone may be with me for a very long time as it works so well. I’m grateful, but I’m also anxious by the thought of being dependent, which we all know has or will happen (85 days on).

I wanted to stop the other drugs being prescribed by pain management because they weren’t working any longer and I was simply over the monthly hassle of going through the PM gauntlet. 

The MAT visits are so easy and simple and I don’t feel on guard all the time. But still, it’s hard for me to think/know Suboxone may be the rest of my life answer for me.

Anyone else using Subs for PM and experience anxiety about being dependent to keep your life moving forward?

I  think something that may be impacting my anxiety is that I’ve had the crap scared out of me by reading some Redditor’s posts about the hell they’ve experienced while tapering and let’s not forget the fear that sits under the surface of “What if I’m in a bad accident.”   

I’m not sure what it will take to decrease my anxiety surrounding Suboxone for life. All I know is I’m feeling tremendously better... pain is controlled, so I’m checked in and present. This is a lovely state to live in a compared to going to PM just to stay out of withdrawal.

I feel like people will take this post the wrong way but please dont. I genuinely feel as though there is such a large portion of this sub reddit that post negatively about there experience either while on subs or there experience getting off subs that maybe there should be a community solely aimed at supporting people who have decided to continue there sobriety without the use of suboxone. A place people can share how long theyve been clean from subs or how there taper is going. 

Its no secret that there is 2 groups of people here and i guess many more that branch off but the main 2 IMO are those that found suboxone and love it who dont think about when theyll stop and share about the benefits theyve gained by being on subs. as well as those who proudly say theyll never stop and take high doses wether there share that openly or not. Then theres those who talk about how horrible suboxone has been for them, how horrible there Dr. were for prescribing high doses and alot of them share how long theyve been clean from suboxone witch is awesome for them im glad.

Im honestly curious why there wouldnt be a seperate subreddit for ex sub users who dont plan on using them again and or people wanting to get off subs and want support in doing so? Im in no way saying either group is better and deserves to be here more than the other please dont think that at all. just thinking from a recovery stand point peer support is a huge key to recovery wether your staying clean from prescribed suboxone or heroin when your in a group of like minded individuals going through the same thing it can only benefit you.

Im relatively new to subs. 3-4 months now. suboxone saved my life and has helped me get off more than opiates. this is the longest most stable sobriety ive had in my entire life. ive posted before that i specifically do not share my dosage  anymore due to criticism and judgements the few times i have mentioned it. and not just a comment or 2 but ALOT of them and harsh ones, to the point of deleting my posts or comments. Ive had people try telling me my Dr. doesnt know whats right for me and im better off trusting people in this sub reddit... And lastly idk if ill be on it for life but i dont at all entertain the idea of stopping. when or if that time comes ill deal with it then. and theres people who dont need to be part of the conversation but only comment to tell you why you should have your taper plan and date ready.

I dont mean to come off as rude, but newly sober and new to suboxone its confusing and i guess scary to see people rejoicing at being suboxone free, and the worst one is people telling newbys (me)that ""the magic wears off"". if i came here and really spent time reading through posts i may not have went through with my induction. I guess this post is more of a conversational one. am i the only one that feels like its weird to have people sharing there sobriety from suboxone dates and horror stories of withdrawals on the same page as brand new patients sober for the first time may just be looking for guidance and reassurance?

I’ve read a ton of posts in this sub that go something like this: “My provider asked me to take a urine test and upload a picture to the app, but I never received my shipment of tests in the mail. My appointment is tomorrow and I’m really worried that I’m going to be cut off”. 

I’m new to doing MAT online and haven’t had any problems so far, but I wanted to make sure my tush was covered just in case something like this ever happened to me. I also wanted to share this here with the hope that it means one less thing to worry about for anyone here. MAT has saved my life more than once, but I’d be lying if I said it didn’t come with the nagging fear that one small hiccup outside of my control could turn my life upside down all over again. Anyway, I’ll stop rambling and get to my point:

USPS offers a free service called “Informed Delivery”. They email you each morning with front and back pictures of every envelope/piece of mail arriving that day. The email doesn’t include packages or boxes, but if you log directly into their website or app, every single package that is addressed to your home (including a tracking number and information on the sender) will appear there the moment a shipping label is created. This will allow you to verify if the tests were even sent in the first place. If they were lost in transit, you’ll be able to see where they ended up or if they ultimately went back to your provider. You can even view packages that were shipped months ago 

If you keep an eye on this and take screenshots as needed (or even better, screenshare with your provider/show them on another device during your video call), this will cover your butt so the liability doesn’t fall on you. If you’re hiding the fact that you’re in MAT from people you live with there’s no need to worry, this info is only accessible to the person that created the account. They don’t mail you anything to confirm your enrollment in the service.

I’m not sure if UPS or FedEx offers a similar service, but many packages shipped via those services will end up in USPS’s hands at some point in the shipping process (and their Informed Delivery system as a result) anyway, because USPS has a more robust delivery infrastructure and handing packages off ends up being cheaper for FedEx/UPS. 

If your packages are getting stolen, that’s an entirely different story and unfortunately, the liability would unfortunately fall on you. If this is your issue, I would talk to your provider about instructing USPS to hold your package at your local post office until you can pick it up, or invest in a lock box.

1158,mtpv2y,"About Day 6 or so of no suboxone.. I decided to stop taking it for about a week to try and drop my dosage drastically. I've often experimented with this and I noticed each time that the withdrawals lessened a bit each time.

Day 1 wasn't too bad, mainly just anxiety.

Day 2 is where things started to feel worse. My joints in my fingers, wrists, elbows, and knees always felt like I had to pop and crack them, my muscles felt sore.

Day 3 is where it seemed to be at its worst. I know a lot of people say that they don't experience peak withdrawals until a good week into detox, but this was when it felt absolutely horrible. My muscles felt pushed past their limit just by walking around a little bit, I couldn't sleep barely at all because of RLS, my skin felt hot and feverish, it just felt so bad that I wanted the day to hurry up and end already.

Day 4 felt mostly the same as Day 3 did up until around late afternoon when it felt like something clicked and my muscles still felt *sore* but not like they were screaming for me to just sit down already. I also noticed that I felt a bit more calm, could laugh at things, and I had a bit of an appetite.

Day 5 I still had some soreness in the legs but I noticed that it was much less noticeable. It mainly seems like my leg muscles wait until I'm about to go to sleep and suddenly feel anxious or tingly and make it hard to sleep. I was able to sleep at night a bit more but still not ideal. It's like I want it warm during the daytime but cold at night. I fell asleep by cranking the AC and picturing myself sleeping in a dark white room surrounded by fans and air conditioners with some rain outside. Haha.

Day 6 I noticed some soreness in my legs, but I don't feel like I have to try and massage them or loosen them up. It just feels like I spent a day walking around a theme park or something. I did manage to fall asleep for about 2.5 to 3 hours earlier and didn't wake up but maybe once. It seems like  the time between sleep disturbances is getting bigger. My skin doesn't have as much of a feverish heat to it either. It's still a bit hot at times, but not nearly as hot as it was.

I'm hoping since the soreness is lessening and the sleep disturbance is getting less frequent that it means I'm somehow on the downward slope, at least in terms of the physical withdrawal. If I feel even better by Day 7 I may just try stay off the suboxone.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Soon after posting this suddenly something clicked again and I actually feel more or less normal now. I know withdrawal can come in waves, but I just feel like I normally do, but with a bit of a chill that creeps up every now and then. My legs don't really hurt anymore. Every once in a while I still feel like I have to pop my wrists or fingers, but not nearly as often. I have a bit of a pressure in the front of my head, kind of like I have a sinus infection. Not really a headache, just a pressure. I'm still having insomnia, but I'm not having RLS, but just feel awake. ",['PPE'],0,0,1,0,0,0

1172,l5fbk2,"Methadone to Suboxone: my experience. I was in Methadone maintenance treatment for 15 years. Opiates/heroin for 10-15 years before that. I built a wonderful life while in treatment.  Ive had the same good job for almost 10 years, I own my home, and have great friends and family. 

Well, I decided to come off it and try my life with absolutely nothing. Biggest mistake ever. My brain came at me HARD. The last few months,  every single day was agony. I also have mental issues and was able to eventually get off those meds and just control it with therapy while on Methadone.  The Methadone truly helped those issues. Now they were loose again and raising hell. 

So, I THOUGHT I had it all under control. I THOUGHT since I had did so good for so long, that I would be fine. I THOUGHT if I did it right and came off very slow I would be fine. I hadn't even thought about drugs for years. 

And then reality hit me hard. Whatever is wrong with my brain that made me an addict did not go away. Doing everything ""right"" will not cure me. It was pure hell to have these cravings back in my life after all these years. It was pure hell to suffer withdrawal symptoms again. It was pure hell to have that addict thinking again, not sleeping, obsessive thoughts, selfishness, all that. The medicine was what allowed me to have a normal life and I was spiraling without it. I've been in many many different treatments over my life, and I used the tools from all these to try and get through this. They helped some, but none of those ever kept me clean before, either. 

Why did I do this to myself? We are conditioned to believe that absolutely ""clean"" is best. Thats not always the case. I guess I wanted to ""prove"" something. All I did was prove to myself why I got in treatment in the first place. I am an addict. I need medication.  Possibly for the rest of my life. I would never expect a diabetic to not take meds and just deal with it with only lifestyle changes. Even though it CAN be done,  it's just not viable for a huge percentage of patients. Including me. 

So, I got on Suboxone and I'm back. My family is so happy. My therapist is happy. And I'm happy. Maybe someday I'll be able to go completely med free. But if not, I'm ok with it. I DO beat myself up a little, in my mind,  for not being able to successfully come off meds, but I'm working through that with my therapist.

Now I am considering getting back on it again, but given the current situation in my area with coronavirus and the fact I live with and care for 2 elderly/high-risk family members, I do not want to endanger anybody with any unnecessary visits to doctors' offices.

Are Suboxone doctors able to start new prescriptions for people like me without having to see us in person as they normally would?

I’ve been on Suboxone for like 3 months and am in the process of getting insurance that pays for the sublocade my doctor prescribed so I can get off of this stuff and not have to take a drug everyday. And for the most part I haven’t had any problem with the Suboxone in the months that I used it until two days ago. The way I normally take it is I break a 8 milligram strip into 4 2 milligram parts and take it spread out across the day 4 different times normally at least 4 hours apart. Then two days ago I took my third dose of the day at 4:30 and my 4th dose an hour and a half later where as I would normally wait until 8 or 9 for the fourth dose. And I felt great after taking the fourth dose. But then two hours later I ate a few pieces of pizza and all of a sudden felt horrible. I felt super foggy and as I tried to sit still I felt real shaky. And it was clearly triggered by the food. Now this situation had happened to me before on Kratom and fellow Kratom users and would call it “the wobbles” and it would always happen to me when I took more Kratom then I should and then ate some carbs. It was always really uncomfortable but then I would simply just not take Kratom for awhile and it would go away. But now with Suboxone that happened two days ago. Then yesterday I still felt foggy and got a head ache when I took my Suboxone and then today felt foggy and shaky when I took it.

To the people who have been on Suboxone maintenance and either quit that successfully or are still on maintenance, does your quality of life improve that much? Would you do it differently if you had the chance? And most importantly, what side effects did you get from the Suboxone? Weight gain, sweats, insomnia, etc. 

I’m scared to be on Suboxone maintenance because I want to feel and experience everything fully and I don’t think that will happen on Suboxone. Songs giving me chills, tearing up during movies…. That type of thing. Did sub mess with any of that for anyone??

1198,mzxcm0,"Question, advice & discussion about doctors now that almost any can prescribe Suboxone. I don’t know why I feel so nervous to post this. I’m usually anxious to post anything in general but I hope my information is correct and my delivery makes sense. If not, please (kindly) educate me! TL;DR at the bottom. 

This January, there was a major shift in addiction medicine policy which awarded doctors more flexibility when it comes to prescribing Suboxone. Previously, as we all know, doctors had to undergo an 8 hour training and receive an “X-waiver” before they could prescribe Bupe. 

Now, my current psychiatrist is kind and I really like her however, a lot of her patients feel as though she uses the Suboxone program to make easy, quick money. When I first started going to her, she charged $150 per monthly visit and $180 every three months for UAs. 

Four months later, after the new year, she raised her prices to $170 per monthly visit and $200 every three months for UAs. I can afford this however, since the policy change, I’ve considered asking my PCP whether or not he could take over my prescriptions in order to save money. Has anyone else done this?

My psychiatrist does not accept insurance. She also prescribes me the antidepressants my PCP formerly prescribed (when I told him I was seeing a psychiatrist, he said he would let her prescribe the antidepressants she found appropriate being it was more her expertise). 

I’m wondering if anyone else has stopped seeing their psychiatrist or addiction specialist and instead begun receiving their maintenance med from their original PCP now that it’s easier for anyone to prescribe. 

Additionally, won’t psychiatrists like mine be forced to lower their prices and/or at least begin accepting insurance with the new policy change? I was fine with paying what I did/do because doctors with an “X-waiver” *were* uncommon in my area. Now that the license is essentially obsolete and unnecessary (from what I understand), wouldn’t this change the rarity, the demand and therefore be reflected in the pricing?

I know I could save *a lot* of money this way. Because of Covid, I have been using Skype for my monthly appointments. Every time we hang up, I see the duration of the call and realize I’m paying $170 to $200 to speak to someone for 3 minutes. 

My only concern with switching (which may just be my over anxious addict brain messing with me) is that I’m afraid my PCP will require me to do something extra and/or possibly begin to taper me sooner than I’m ready for. To be honest, my psychiatrist has never discussed tapering with me. On the contrary, she said it’s common for people to remain on Suboxone for life (to each their own - this is not something I am planning to do, though).

1207,du1xno,"Acute and Chronic Pain Management. Hello Folks,

I'll try and make this as brief as possible.

I am on 8mg of Subutex daily, I've tapered off once and been ""forced"" off twice due to major surgeries (that's also how I quit smoking).

I was on it last December when I shattered my upper left distal humerus (you should see the 3D CT scan I have of it). I have very little memory of the next 32 hours as the hospital couldn't control my pain, due to the buprenorphine.

I got off it over a week as I was on IV morphine, and then five days later (the break happened 23rd December 2018 at about 10 pm - perfect timing) had a planned 2 hour, ended up being six-hour, surgery to repair it. I was sent home and was kept on liquid morphine 10mg/5ml for a few weeks, then DHC, then codeine then off.

I started having seizures again, and due to this along with two major bowel surgeries in a year and the arm led me to resign from work to take enough time off to recover. This was July 2019.

I have Crohn's Disease (one of the two inflammatory bowel diseases) which was quiescent during a colonoscopy in March but started to flare back up again three weeks ago. After several foul up's with my GP prescribing the incorrect steroids (I can't take corticosteroids as they cause psychosis -- even being on them for three days this time around led to some rather wild behaviour) I still cannot get sufficient pain relief.

They scripted me 50x 400mcg Temgesic bupe PCA on top of my regular 8mg. This did, to be frank, fuck all.

They wouldn't give me morphine or \*codone due to the quantity required to kick the bupe out could cause respiratory distress or carry an extreme risk of triggering another seizure. I've had 800mg of codeine in 24 hours trigger one. 

So.... what the hell do other people do? I'm in the UK so alprazolam isn't an option. My GP is well aware I am a polyaddict so anything higher than 2mg diazepam is out of the question as are sedative-hypnotics such as z-drugs.

I could go to A&E (ER) wait 12 hours and be sent home. The pain is extreme when acute, but it's due to short term inflammation and not worth wasting a hospital bed on. That and I've spent more than three months on a hospital ward over the past two years.

1213,t6lwq1,"Gabapentin- Not so easy to aquire anymore ?. This was a topic,,, rather a prediction,,, many months ago. Its interesting to hear how those who profit view the drugs that actually work vs those that do not. Doctors have always made it difficult to acquire drugs that patients want unless they get to prescribe them. I remember reading an article on how doctors once wanted to make ibuprofen and acetaminophen Scheduled drugs- which only a doctor can prescribe. And not just any doctor, most say they cannot prescribe certain scheduled drugs like opiods- only pain management doctors may prescribe them, anything more than 3 days anyways. 

Now the medical community wants to place gabapentin as a Scheduled drug, making it harder to aquire. My old primary care provider could Not prescribe scheduled drugs as he said he refuses to ""pay the $6,000 for the software and thousands per month to use it- which is required to monitor scheduled drugs"".  At first glance it may appear about control and safety- but its just about the money imo. 

Making gabapentin a scheduled drug means the software/hardware is needed to verify prior/current prescription history, its makers get a cut $. The (PDMP) Prescription Drug Monitoring Program itself must be manned, they get a cut $. Then there is the pharmacy who Also needs the same hardware/software,, and provide labor needed for this extra verification step- more costs to pass on to patient$. Dont forget the lobbyists who are in the game by pushing such policies- they get a cut too $$$. Then there's the politicians who move to back the requests by lobbyists- there nasty little paws are grabbing for their cut also $$$$. Making it more difficult might seem to be a move for safety reasons,  Or is it ?

**I want to share my suboxone story the last 4-4.5 years so skip to the bottom if you want**

I shouldn’t have ever been put on suboxone. I went in to my doctor completely blind and didn’t know what suboxone even was. I can’t even say right now that I fully understand it. As I began suboxone Dec 16, 2014, it took maybe 2 months for me to go into a depression if you will. I refused to go out unless it was to see my psychiatrist (let’s call her Dr V) every month or go to the pharmacy to pickup my suboxone. As months went by, my hygiene went to hell. I admit to going a month without showering. I’ve said this before and I’m not ashamed of it. This was MY life, MY reality and how suboxone effected ME. So keep your comments to yourself on this subject. Because of my hygiene, I wouldn’t want to go out even more. I couldn’t get the energy to do it. I fell out of what my regular daily routine was. Every single day before suboxone, I’d shower, do my make up and hair and go out even if it was driving around listening to music alone. I couldn’t bear to stay in my house all day even if it was for an hour I was gone. 

Because I wouldn’t shower or go out, I’d call Dr V and reschedule my appointments last minute. I only had to see her once a month. It was a 40 minute drive. This happened multiple times until she’d had enough and discharged me as her patient. At the time she discharged me, I had been trying 6mg of suboxone but what she didn’t know since I hadn’t seen her was after a week or 2, I went back down to 4mg because I felt no different. Legally, she had to give me a month worth of suboxone so she wrote it out for 6mg. At this point which was a year or so being on suboxone, I thought I’d taper myself off with what I was given. I got myself down to 4mg and I was already addicted to it and I knew I couldn’t just stop cold turkey. I didn’t want to. I found a clinic where I didn’t have to go every day. I would be able to go bi-weekly. I had an appointment set with them for 11am. When I pulled in to the clinic, I was in the ghetto. I was by myself and I’m a tiny girl and was scared. It’s nothing against anyone there but it was scary. I remember it being pretty crowded. I had a hat on because my hair looked dirty and I sat down to a guy with a lime green 5c iPhone. My brother who passed away April 2014 had that phone and my mom was actually using it. I put my head down with my hat over my eyes and started tearing up because it was then that I felt my brother was with me and every thing would be ok. I remember waiting for my turn to give a urine sample and a dude that was 2 people ahead of me. He went and gave the front desk his sample and then asked if he could now go use the bathroom to go #2. I wanted to die. The bathroom turned out to be disgusting when r was my turn. I loaded toilet paper all over the seat and gave them my sample. I ended up waiting 2 hours. I sat in a seat with no one nearby and again, hat down and cried. I texted my dad saying how awful this was. How upset I was that this happened to my life. There were 2 guys going in to see the doctor after me. They asked what dose I was on and I said 4mg. They told me how hard it’s gonna be once I get to 2mg (really sweet of them to say at that time 🙄). When I saw the doctor, she couldn’t believe I was on such a LOW dose. Turns out I was on the lowest dose out of all her patients. She gave me s script for 4mg and said to come back in 2 weeks. I cried on my way home and sobbed to my mom when I got home. I called Dr V sobbing and after giving me a small lecture, she took me back. 

Things were going fine with Dr V. It wasn’t until I emailed her asking if she could give me a few more Xanax until I saw her in 3-4 days as I had ran out claiming that I had a lot of anxiety the last week. The reason I ran out early was because my mom is on Xanax too and we would take each other’s every so often and then both run out. I know that sounds like her and I eeee abusing Xanax but I can swear that was not it. I thought I’d just see what Dr V would sag as she tends to be generous. The exact response I got back from Dr V was, “Meghan, This is a real issue, we discussed you not taking more xanax then I am prescribing. I cannot give you more and we might have to discuss rehab if this pattern of behavior continues.” I immediately panicked. I saw her 4 days later and she had gotten the records from my pharmacy and saw I was even filling my Xanax early. She told me she was discharging me and that I’d either need to go to detox or an IOP. I walked out of her office crying my eyes out. Long story short, I found a new suboxone psychiatrist and both my mom and I agreed he was too good to be true. I canceled going to him too many times do he discharged me as his patient as well. He has NO plans to taper me from 2mg either. That was all I wanted. I went to an IOP and the only doctor who could prescribe suboxone dosed me down like 3 times and at 1-1.5mg said that was small enough and I was done and could stop. I knew he was wrong. As we got up to talk to my case manager, he said he’d meet me there as he forgot something. A bathroom was across from his office and when he wasn’t me in his office, I ran in. I cried and texted a few people. I walked out. I didn’t tell anyone. They called ONCE and left a voicemail. I didn’t call back. They never even bothered to try calling me again. 

I was able to call the psychiatrist I saw before going to IOP and he took me back. He put me on Nuvigil since I was constantly tired. I went to the pharmacy and they needed it to be pre authorized. I called the doctor and he answered but was annoyed. It took a few days to get it approved and I kept calling the doctor to hurry up. I didn’t care how much I would pay if insurance declined it. One night, he cursed at me. I told him to go duck himself and hung up. The next day or so, I called Dr V and told her what happened. She took me back and we immediately began my taper. That was all I had been wanting. I proved to her I was serious. I was always at my monthly appointments. She’s been so helpful and proud of me. My therapist has been the best thing ever. I don’t know if I’d be off suboxone without her. I didn’t know how bad I needed her until I decided to try her out. The only other thing that sucked was my teeth. They rotted from the suboxone strips and I did slow down my lack of taking care of them. $3200 later and I can smile without being embarrassed. [You can see the before and after here](http://imgur.com/Xewgpzm).

I know that was a long story and many of you may not have even read it and that’s fine lol. But I’ve gone through hell. I really have in just 4 years. I don’t doubt for s second that everyone in this subreddit has gone through it and probably worse. I shared my story because I know how hard it is being in suboxone if you don’t need it. But I also can’t express enough that suboxone is a life saving drug. No one should be ashamed to be on it whether it’s short term or long term. As long as you’re living your life drug free and clean, who cares! Anyone who judges deserves to be curb stomped. It’s better to be on this and live a regular life then ruining your life with getting drugs off the street that are getting worse every day and inclining the drug epidemic so incredibly high (no pun intended lmao). 

My biggest fear has been not taking it every morning with my other daily medicine. Today, I woke up more excited not to take it because I AM DONE! I made my choice to be done and it’s taken years to be ready. Even when tapering I’d tell everyone but mainly my therapist who has been with me since I started my taper, I don’t know how I’m going to do this. I needed my psychiatrist to keep me at a strict dose of it or I never would’ve begun my taper. No one wants to run out of suboxone so it pushed me to make sure I took the right dose every day. 

I’m sure I’ll feel shitty soon for hopefully only a week or two at max. But who knows. Plus the biodegradability of suboxone is half so I was likely taking more like 0.032mg. I hate this saying but it’s true... if I can do it, I swear you can. It takes time and determination but you can be where I now am. Hell, I was one of the people just a few weeks ago being jealous of everyone who was finally off it! Here I am and I actually am in tears because I never expected this. I also know I wouldn’t have done this without my brother watching over me and giving me the strength to keep going. I’m so blessed to have him as my guardian angel.

During that time, I relapsed a ton... Ive gone on a month long ""bender"" and I've gone two weeks between each use just because I couldn't bear say goodbye to my ol' friend Heroin. But, the last 8 months, I haven't had a single fuck-up.  No alcohol, nothing - and I have never felt better. I (and everyone around me) was so proud and I felt it may be truly past me.

But, apparently, that wasn't a good enough excuse for me to stay away forever; I still hadn't gotten rid of that ""burning"" to someday use again.  And my chance finally came.

Earlier in the week, after a fight with my husband over something ridiculously stupid, he left for work (overnight shift) and I messaged my old dealer.  We ended up linking up around 12/12:30am and, after doing a shot, I felt great.  My dealer (who has a pretty big crack addiction) wanted me to drive him to his guys house for some rock, and said we could sit in his house and hang out for a bit.  I thought nothing of it and decided to go - because usually that means free drugs for me if I give him rides places and I obvioiusly wasn't thinking on a sober mind.

So, my dealer's crack dealer's house was super sketchy.  I didn't like it one bit.  I thought it may be me being paranoid from smoking a hit of rock, but something felt off to me.  A guy kept calling the crack dealer's phone and wanted more without any money, and then kept saying he got less than he was supposed to with the money he gave him earlier.  The dealer said he was out and they were basically arguing back and forth almost like boyfriend/girlfriend.  This whole conversation is happening loud as fuck on a phone using speakerphone around 1:00am in a triple-decker apartment.  Twenty minutes later, some guy pounds on the door and it was the guy from the phone call.  He basically demands the guy fronts him more and they argue until crack dealer goes to get it and then phone call guy leaves.  At this point, I was pretty fucking nervous about not wanting to get busted for being so loud, and I didn't want to have to call my husband in the middle of the night for bail money and to explain that i fucked up again, so I told my dude I was leaving.  We left, I took him home and that was that.  It was uncomfortable, I regretted it as usual the next day, and I thought it was over. 

The next day I read the news headline and apparently that phone call guy came back to crack dealer's house at 2:30am with his friend, tied this guy up in his apartment with duct tape, cut him up with a knife, a cleaver, and a broken beer bottle, put a cloth laundry bag over his head, stabbed him some more, stole his safe with his shit and left him for dead.  The cops came and the guy was pronounced dead. 

I literally missed out on being a victim of the ""wrong place at the wrong time"" and literally can't get it out of my mind that if I didn't leave when I did, those guys could have fucking killed me.  I have been thinking about this all day the last two days, and I told my husband about that night because I am so shaken up.  I literally never thought that being a simple user every now and then could put me in a situation of being almost murdered, but I literally missed death by 30-45 minutes.  I would have never seen my kids again, my parents, my husband, nobody.  One angry night where I was without kids I decide to fuck up and do drugs and it could have turned into my kids reading about my murder and learning I was in a drug den.  

I just wanted to share my story because 1) it is literally eating me alive and 2) I hope nobody on here ever encounters this.  But, thankfully this is exactly the wake-up call I needed to never pick up another drug ever ever again.

1219,em16pj,"Just finished detoxing at a facility going home tomorrow. Hey y’all, new to reddit. Anyway I had 5.5 years clean of opiates (used weed and alcohol) but relapsed 6 months ago and was using about 300 mg a day within two - three months(back to where I left off in 2013) I did Vivitrol for 15 months back then. I did abuse the alcohol a little if I’m being honest with myself so this time I am going to try to stick to not drinking. Anyway, my family doc thinks suboxone is a good fit for the first 6-12 months of my recovery. I guess I’m just unsure and wondering y’all’s thoughts on the matter? Is that even possible?

1220,fpwm1q,"Dr. Reddy's VS. Sandoz Brand. Good morning all. This is going to be more of a rant post as I'm at wits end with my local pharmacy and this Dr. Reddy's brand of strips. For the past 2 months the pharmacy that I'm locked into; which I don't fully understand because I'm a self pay client and not Medicaid or any insurance company that locks me into only one pharmacy. It's my clinic I go to who is locking me to one pharmacy. Up till a couple months ago I was getting the Sandoz brand, which is pretty much identical to the brand name. The generic is all I can afford being self pay by the time I pay the clinic bill; which too, is another matter entirely that I'll mention later. 

Enter Dr. Reddy's brand strips...awful, just awful. I can dose at 7 am in the morning before work and by 5 pm it feels as if I'd skipped a dose. They don't even dissolve as well as the other generic brand and I get a mild headache after dosing with them. My Dr. even requested the Sandoz brand and NOT the Dr. Reddy's brand and even explained why I didn't want them. Fast forward to the time to go pick them up...I go in as I normally do, ask for my prescription, present my ID and pay out the Ying Yang for 56 strips, go to walk out but before I do, it hits me to look in the bag and look in my bottle...Damned Dr. Reddy's brand strips again. I say ah Hell no and politely ask to speak to the pharmacist who filled this crap. He asks what the issue is and I explain the situation while he's already shaking his head in disagreement then cuts me off claiming there's no difference in the Sandoz and Dr Reddy's brand strips except for the names and design, they do what they're made to do. I disagreed and said you can say that because you aren't on this medication and have to take it on a daily basis. He says, it's all we carry now in the generic because they're the same. By this time I already knew where this was heading so now I was getting aggravated and said you're pharmacy is using them because they are dirt ass cheap and you can buy them cheap, then sell each strip at the maximum you can get out of them and make a killing. I asked for my money back and just to cancel the prescription that I didn't want them and wasn't going to pay them hundreds of dollars for a product that was trash. For those of you who aren't aware, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Dr. Reddy's brand strips has been sued for potency issues before. They are a company out of India known for making cheap priced generics, then selling them overseas at a huge profit but non benefit to many who have the misfortune of getting them. Anyway, the pharmacy refused to refund my money using a policy that I had opened the bag therefore they don't have to refund my money excuse. So, I made it clear I would be taking my business elsewhere after 6 years of this being my pharmacy and having the attitude about me questioning his expertise then asking for my money back. So now I'm stuck once again with a brand that I can absolutely 100% without a doubt, tell a considerable difference in throughout the day, after taking it. Between this situation and what I consider my clinic screwing me on what they are charging me, I'm getting aggravated and just want to come off this shit altogether. 

My clinic, is charging me $436 a month for services not being rendered. Most clients there, especially newer ones have to have 4 hrs of groups including face time with a counselor. Where I've been there so long, I do not. I have one hour a month, see the Dr. and that's it. This month, due to the COVID-19 outbreak our state has pulled the switch on people going to the clinic for any groups or sessions whatsoever. I've only had to have one hour a month for the past three months after being grandfathered in on a new thing they're doing with senior clients with 5 years or more. My understanding is, there are only seven of us that qualified for this. Cool, fine. However, they're charging us full price of $436 a month out of pocket. It's $108 a week if you're weekly, which requires 4 hrs a month of facetime and groups if you're newer client. I approached the people who are involved with taking the payment weekly or monthly and asked if there should be some type of pro-rated prices to clients not having these extra services rendered and I was told, ""We have to treat everyone here the exact same and to cut cost of your monthly fee would feel like we're showing favoritism among clients."" Whaaa? Tell me that drug addiction doesn't pay. It pays them and companies take full advantage of addicts. 

Sorry for such a long post and congrats to those who stuck around to read it. It's just that at this time, I find myself growing frustrated with recovery and the current situation with my pharmacy, brand of medication and the clinic I go to. I'm certain that I can surely can't be the only one who feels this way or has felt this way at some point.","['AL', 'PPE', 'MA']",1,1,1,0,0,0
1221,8uukcg,"3 days till jump. Been taking 0.25 in the morning and 0.20 at night. Been a struggle during the day.

But today I took my dose at 0.20 this am and so far outside being a bit tired, I feel I finally adjust to taking 0.25 or less in the day. I'll be working down my night dose and just taking during the day,  0.25 starting tomorrow and Sunday since I don't have work or anything.

The worst symptoms of the taper seem to be 3 hours between my day and night dose unless I stay busy and I wake up at 5am most mornings with a stomach ache. Advil and a 0.25 Xanax seems to help me get back to sleep and feel comfort. I've avoided the Xanax during the day and found CBD vape oil to be extremely helpful and it seems to last even the day after as far as therapeutic relief. I also run 3 days a week

So with the jump coming up, im guessing this is pretty positive with taking such a little crumb in morning being ok to deal for 12 hours. I will have a month off work, therapy and going to New York for a trip on day 27 for 4 days.

SO..I had used for 1 year (snorting 35 a day).  Got 20 days clean, and have now used about 3 pills a day for 10 days.  So using 10% of normal use for about 2 weeks.

It took me 74 hours before I could take suboxone to help.  How long might I assume it will take to use suboxone again?  

I am trying to guess if I need to be prepared to take 2 days off work..3 days..the whole week?  Or will this not be that bad and maybe just 24-48 hours?

I asked a doctor and their answer was absurdly stupid..""use the COWS system and take when you're in moderate to severe withdrawal.""  OK DOC..that would be 30 hours when it peaks.  You want me to take 2mg of suboxone at 30 hours? I'd want to KILL MYSELF I'd be in such horrible PWD. lol.  For me...I CAN ONLY tolerate subs when my withdrawal symptoms are at a low point on Day 4.

1302,fdvsim,"Made it to day 30 without suboxone.. It feels like yesterday when I finally made the jump. 

Here’s the backstory. I’ll try not to drag it out too much.

I started with pills on and off in ‘07. I was really hooked on opiates by 2010. My cousin handed me a sub and I immediately felt like I never took anything ever. The WD feeling went away. After that, I bought subs off of the street until 2011. My plug stopped having them so I CT’d off of 6-8 mgs. It was hell on earth. I had no idea what subs were and how powerful they were. I just knew they took all my cravings away. However, after 2-3 days of WDs, I found out how powerfully they were.

I remember looking up the World Record for days without sleep. I was on day 7 without any sleep. I just stared at my ceiling, tossing and turning...praying to get some sleep. It never happened. I didn’t know about comfort meds, so I just took NyQuil hoping that would help. It made it worse.

I finally went to the doc and he prescribe Klonopin. That finally helped me sleep after day 8.

Anyway, I made it three months without any subs or opiates. I only took a klonopin before bed. In those three months, I always felt terrible. I never really got over it. So...I relapsed. I relapsed in the worst way. 

I ended up spending like $200/day on pills. I’d buy adderall and whatever opiate pill I could find. I had dealers ripping me off. I’d go to some of the nastiest houses and hang out with some bad people just to get my fix. I kept doing this for six years. Six years of wasting all that time and money. 

The reason I never went back to subs is because the WDs terrified me. But I ran out of money. I dipped into my retirement, I maxed out credit cards. Finally, I went to a sub doc in May 2017.

The addiction specialist said I should start with 16mg; I started with 6mg. I decided I wanted to go as low as I could. I was fine on 6mg. I felt like that was a good starting point. 

Eventually, all the side effects kicked in. I was tired all the time, I had brain fog, depression, teeth issues, anxiety, irritability, weight gain, and I isolated myself from the outside world. I’d work, then come home and watch TV. I stopped answering text messages and phone calls. A lot of my friends stopped bothering to contact me.

So...I decided it was time to get off. I started working out every morning before work and I slowly tapered down. The taper was fairly painless until I got to 1mg. Once I hit 1mg, I never stabilized. I was on 1mg for three months and it felt like I was constantly in mild WD. I don’t know why it felt like that. I think it could’ve been because I was breaking the 2mg pill and I would lose some or because I was working out 5-6 days a week. I thought the sub might be metabolizing to fast. I don’t know.

Because I felt like I was in constant WD, I figured, fuck it. Why am I dragging this out? I talked to my AS and he said since I was in such a low dose, it shouldn’t be bad (he actually thought I was on 2mg). The doc gave me a two week supply of lucemyra and said good luck. I took the next week off of work and was ready...really ready to break free from subs and pills. 

Well, as crazy as this sounds, I really didn’t have any bad WDs. When I would have some RLS, I’d take a lucemyra. I took two during the day and two at night. I would get 6-7 hours of sleep. It was hard to get out of bed and my brain was foggy, but not so bad. After two weeks, I stopped taking lucemyra. I remember how great it felt to finally have a day without any sort of pill whatsoever.

Now, here I am on day 30. Each day I take a daily vitamin, cod liver oil, and vitamin B complex. I also work out every morning and drink tons of water. I’m still a bit hazy and lethargic, but it’s nothing I can’t handle. 

I think what really helped me this time was my mindset. When I originally WD from subs, I kept waiting to wake up hoping I’d feel 100 percent. It would drive me insane that after two then three months, I was still feeling so terrible. I thought I was broken. I just wanted it to stop. 

This time, I have the mindset that I’m not going to feel 100 percent and that’s OK. I learned to adjust through my taper; therefore, I can adjust without any subs. Eventually, I’ll be back to 100 percent (I feel close), but for now, I know I need to give a little more effort to get out of bed, to make it to the gym, to be productive at work, to maintain relationships. It’s something I’ve accepted and soon enough, I’ll be back to 100 percent. It may not be tomorrow or even next month, but I’ll get there. In the meantime, I’ll have to maintain at 80 percent. No big deal.

I’m happy that I went back to subs. They helped me get my life back. I’m still working on paying off my debts, but I’ve made a ton of progress. I understand that a lot of people will need to stay on subs forever, and that’s fine. I think they’re much better than the alternative. However, the side effects for me were too much. They were taking my soul away. I never really laughed on them. My feelings were almost nonexistent. I didn’t want to continue through life as a zombie (again, that’s just the way I felt on them). For me, I knew I had to get off.

Thanks for all the support on r/suboxone. I know I couldn’t get through it without following this subreddit. It really is a huge help. I know I still have a long way to go, but I’m actually looking forward to the journey.

I took the subs and they did absolutely nothing so naturally the next day I went back to using with the idea that I’d tell my doc what happened And try again a few days later.

To give you a l title context I will share the most current part of my story as it relates to getting on subs this time.  I spent most of 2018 in and out of county. Using heavily on the outside. Then December 2018 I got arrested and was in for about 6 months. Got out last summer and went to an intense long term women’s rehab. 

I graduated and moved into sober living. Did okay there for maybe a month then stared dabbling again. Fast forward a few months I ended up in the hospital w cellulitis in my arm from re using a needle. 

Went back to treatment for about a week. Realized there was no way I was going through that whole thing again when I already had all the information and was choosing to just be stupid. 

So I left treatment and sober living and moved in with my mom. I was having a lot of trouble at SL w other women constantly going in and out. That made staying clean infinitely harder for me. Once I moved home I used maybe 3-4x before I realized this was fucking ridiculous and really just got completely turned off at the whole idea of continuing down that road. 

Didn’t start subs right away. Maybe after a month or so because I “felt like I needed them.”  A lot of anxiety surrounding work etc. I only ever wanted to do the shot but my doctor is such a fucktard that’s happened once in the 3-4 months I’ve been taking subs (the other times just being on strips) 

I’m taking strips now. I ended up leaving that job to work from home.  The stomach issues are just so fucking bad I feel like a goddamn balloon walking  around. When I started on them a few months ago I felt some Relief. Definitely a lot more even. 

But now I just feel sluggish. I have no desire to go get high again and now that I am working from home and stress levels have subsided immensely I’m just wondering if now isn’t the perfect time to call it quits. I would Taper of course. It just feels like time is of the essence as I’ve only been on subs for a few months. 

In this time I have entirely stayed away from opiates. I did fuck around trying to shoot my subs for a short while until I was like wtf. Your so dumb. That’s been over. Also now that I am finally back at home the thought of going down that whole road again has absolutely 0 appeal. All those ppl are locked up. I’m so over it and ready to just get on with my life and be an independent adult. 

I’d rather get off now while I’m still freelancing and have the ability to work from home. I can continue doing this until I feel like I’m able to go back to work in an office job- that’s what I really want to do. Having the opportunity to take this time for myself has been so incredibly helpful. I’m very grateful for where I am today. I just know I’ll only be postponing the inevitable by staying on and I’d very my like to leave this ‘chapter’ (I.e years upon years of my life) totally behind me. 

If you read this far then thank you. This journey on subs has been rather lonely as I’ve been in and out of the program enough to know not to share this type of thing. It’s really nice to have support from those on this sub and I appreciate you taking the time to read through. I’m really interested to hear whatever you have to say- either about my journey or as any of this has related to yours.

Day 20, 9 days away from receiving 2nd shot 

So, it’s almost been a full month.The first week was great. I felt completely stable and totally normal. Going into the second and third weeks, I began to struggle. I would experience just a couple of withdrawal symptoms at a time, and they would stick around for a few hours and then fade away. I just kept feeling like I was going back-and-forth from feeling totally normal to feeling like I was unstable.￼ but, I will emphasize that the symptoms I have dealt with I’ve been fairly mild. And only a couple at a time. So, for example, I would be dealing with swelling and temperature changes along with diarrhea and huge lack of energy OR I’d experience gooseflesh and temperature changes along with yawning and the constant desire to stretch. But, mentally, I never felt that...panic. I didn’t feel like I was dealing with any of the psychological features of withdrawal. So, I could actually deal with it fairly well. I always had faith that I would go back to feeling normal, and that always seemed to happen.￼￼￼ Now, sleeping has been a real roller coaster. I’ll go a couple nights without the ability to fall asleep, but then I’ll be able to catch up with a good nap the next afternoon. ￼ it’s like my body is totally aware of the medication being present, but isn’t quite sure how to use it all the time. I am 100% confident that after my second shot, I will be completely stable. The second shot is another 300 mg shot, and I think that that will just fill in all the gaps and give my body what it needs. Also, I think I will be completely adjusted by then, too. 

Just a reminder, I was on 12 mg a day before I begin the shot.￼￼ I have been told that anyone under 24 mg qualifies for the shot, but I do think that towards the higher end of the spectrum, it may not work as well. But don’t quote me on that bc that’s just my opinion. 

My doctor has reminded me that if I ever needed anything, I should call. I have definitely kept that in the back of my mind, but I have not called her as I feel like it is more important for me to adjust to life without daily medication. I haven’t been feeling bad enough to need any help.￼￼ i’ve also been seeing the beauty of recovery at work, too. And that is comforting. Through those days when I’m not feeling good, I can rely on the things I have learned in recovery to get me through. I have reached out and talked to someone, I have kept my mind on positive things, I’ve taken time for self-care, and I have chosen to feel proud of myself during this time.

Even after an hour quite a bit is left and I can’t eat or drink during so it’s kinda a pain. 

Question is how do I get it for pain. My pain management doctor said he can’t prescribe it for pain due to dea regulations. I thought they can prescribe it off label for pain without a dea waiver but I’m unsure and haven’t found a good source on it. I guess how do I find a doctor who is willing to and can prescribe it for pain? And will I be labeled an addict for doing so and denied pain medication in the future? Do I have to pretend to be addicted to opiates to get it? 

Also for those that take it for pain do you notice it kinda stops helping with the pain after only 6, hours while belbuca adversities 12 hour pain relief?

Btw I’m currently taking 150 micrograms twice a day but it absorbs better so this is about .285mg of suboxone twice a day. Also since this isn’t helping for pain I’m taking about 10-15mg of hydrocodone in-between dosages to kinda help make it stronger and prolong the pain relief.","['AL', 'MA']",1,1,0,0,0,0

It hurt 100 times worse than the first one I got. I don’t know why, but it felt like bee stings on fire. In my belly.

I expressed my obvious appreciation for therapy for venting and actually knowing that speaking to a “professional” which is super helpful for my anxiety. One thing we both talked about was pet-peeves when it comes to counseling, one main one being when your counselor forgets big factual details from your life and stories you tell them. Like big key details, not the name of your cat or color of your car, I’m not that stupid I know these people have a bunch of clients but still, you think that after going for 6 months or so they’d remember your relationship status or where you work or have some relative idea . This is referring to frequent appointments to be clear , like two-four times a month appointments.  Idk maybe that’s just me. My biggest pet-peeve though is when they ask a question that I can totally see coming like, any use? any thoughts of use? Or when it seems that they’re just going down a line of questions they have to ask us “crazies”. This has been extremely prominent in over the phone appointments for a few friends as well.  I feel that sometimes these people forget the weight of their jobs and how this may be the last person someone tries to talk to and get help.

I just made a plan with my doctor today about jumping off the subs in July! By then it will be 23 months on the Suboxone. I give a lot of credit to this med because it really helped me get my life back on track. I am honestly just getting fed up with the side effects. I hate being zombified, depressed, having low libido, having no energy, having amped up anxiety, etc. I know a ton of people get side effects and i know some people don’t. Sadly for me I feel like I deal with all the worst side effects. 

i weened down from 16mg a day to about .5 every day and next month i’ll be skipping days. I never had a problem weening and I did it really slowly. I never felt sick or felt any bad withdrawal as i was going down and that’s probably because most of the time i was weening very slowly. The thing i wanted to ask is for positive feedback on getting off the subs and to see if people feel better once they’re off? Will my libido come back? Will i have more energy? Will i feel normal again? I’m aware some of this may take some time to come back. Im 22 years old and i feel like an old man. I just can’t wait to start my real sobriety and to be off of all the meds i’m on. I was always really healthy before the drugs and i hope my life will go back to that. I appreciate all of the advice you guys give me. I am fully aware the withdrawal will suck, I have quit Xanax cold turkey after years of abusing it. I am just so motivated to get off the subs that I am willing to feel like shit for a little while.

Before that I was on 16mg day for 5 months and went back to Oxy IR for 6 weeks or so and have been on sub for 10 months since. Basically the sub stops working for my pain and if I switch for a few weeks it will work again for at least a few months and will slowly stop (sev spinal stenosis). Anyways the last time I switched my tolerance was super high or i did something wrong when transitioning that caused this I dont know. It basically took 6+ 30s per day to make me not sick but my pain was somewhat better.. switched back because I obviously could not continue to take 6-8 30s a day and not even feel decent however the subs then worked well for my pain for about 3 months and slowly stopped to where the last 3-4 months have been hell. My sub doc told me that about 1 years use will REDUCE the receptor count so one day I would be able to take 5-10mg and ""feel"" it again but this could take 10 months - 2 years but he thought it would be about a year or less for me.. My question is this.. if I switch now after 10 months will my tolerance still be crazy high or should it be somewhat reset? Whats the best way to figure this out? or is this bullshit? Slowly dosing the IR good? If I can get to a respectable dose I can then figure surgery out without the fear of being in massive pain while they will only give 5mg but i need 35mg per dose.

1347,grqoab,"Help understanding. Hello all. I need some advice. I relapsed back in January, prior to that I was on subs and completely clean for a year. Before I put together that year I used to take a sub one day, use the next, then take a sub the next day or day after (depending on how much money or dope i had, etc.) However these past 4-5 months I've only used h. So i need to induce again. 

From my.undersanding, when I used in the past I would still have subs on my receptors when I would use h so it wasn't an issue getting going back and forth. Now that I've been off subs so long I need to withdraw and then take my subs (tried twice, pwd's twice) and since I'm 99.9999% sure that the shit I'm doing is cut with fent/analog of, I need to wait, like, 36-48 hours atleast. Which is different because when I first started suboxone, idk 5-6 years ago it was dope, not d/fent/god knows what else, so after like 12 hours I was good to take a sub and the wds were minimum and no pwd's.

Heres the problem, Ican't get that far (MINIMUM 24 hours) Even with benzos, gaba, pot, and i just don't know what to do anymore because I'll get to 16-18 hours, be sick but I know it's not long enough, and so I go pick up because the wds are just gonna get worse from there, use, don't get high just well, and start all over. I also can't just take enough benzos to just knock myself out because, ya know, life, kids, wife (who has no clue just thinks I'm on subs still)

So I guess the real questions out of that wall of text are:

1. how can I get to 24+ hours into wds with helper meds listed above? 

2. should i even take the subs, or just wd from the dope (I don't want to call it heroin because frankly it isn't anymore.)

3. I've never wd from dope, whats it like, how long does it last typically.

4. Is it possible to do a dope taper, if so can someone help me out? I currently use between a buns (10 bags, I'm in the north east of the country)- 1.5 buns a day

5. My doc will rx any helper meds I want. Literally, probably, anything  so..(except opiates/opioids)

1354,h0goet,Ug pain. I'm taking to reddit assuming the hive mind can produce results. I'm 2 days off of a pretty heavy street dope habit (ECP) and on day 2 of buprenorphine/nalox and in agony. I've been in withdrawal the entire time. Full on brutal withdrawal. how long should I expect this to last? Doc had me on 4 then 8mg of Bup yesterday then today 4 then that's it. It's always way worse after I take the meds. I'm in precipitated withdrawal or whatever it's called aren't I? Any idea of a timeline?,"['PPE', 'CDU']",0,0,1,1,0,0
1355,h8qmv9,"[Trigger Warning] Could the side effects of Suboxone be contributing to my worsening depression?. Hey guys. First and foremost I would just like to say that I am grateful for everyone here. Honestly, had I not found you guys my MAT Suboxone journey would feel much more isolating than it has been already. I am just really thankful for everyone’s advice and support. 


Okay, so...I have been on Suboxone (MAT) for 107 days- today. In the almost 4 months I have been on Suboxone maintenance my very severe clinical & often suicidal depression has gotten worst despite being in addiction treatment once a week, psychotherapy for mental health once a week plus regular check ins with my psychiatrist for mental health medication management. I don’t know what more I can do for myself help wise? I spend 97% of my time indoors without any social interaction mostly due to the other factors such as no energy & constant weakness. I have zero motivation to take care of my appearance & basic self care is out the window. I am not thriving in sobriety although sober! I see zero difference in my depression levels, motivation & overall well-being. The only difference is I am not chasing around a bag. I still very much look like I am on drugs. I feel hopeless. I have been like this for 4 years now, I started self medicating with prescription pain meds between 6-9 months after the depression I have until this day, set in. I started using due to depression & I quit using due to depression. My main motivating factors each time I have gotten clean in the last 4 years was my thought that if I could kick using then maybe I could get back to the person I was before depression came.. I thought maybe the depression had come & gone already & that it was just the drugs holding me back. I soon realize each time after sobering up that I am severely depressed either way. I would go as far to say that depression has taken a much bigger toll on my appearance than opiates even had the chance too...

You know how you see your old druggie   who kicked drugs, got into a program, started MAT & put on they adorable healthy weight since they have been clean? They practically glow & are always smiling ear to ear when you see them. At points even inspired you to fight for your own sobriety? 

Yeah, how come that never comes for me? If anyone here knew the person I was before my gradual depressive decline you would be shocked. For over 10 years I was an Norwegian-American runway model until I was 25 years old, about to finish my education when the depression set in later that year & I lost everything.

Has anyone else experienced this? Anyone else start using to self medicate suicidal depression? Does it get better? Do you or anyone else you know feel like Suboxone makes you feel sick & weak? Or that it directly contributes to worsening symptoms in patients with preexisting depression disorder?  I don’t really know where to go from here except for to eliminate Suboxone to see if it helps. I am so desperate to get some sort of quality of life back, some normalcy that I am not even interested in using drugs at all. I feel safe getting off after 4 months of Suboxone MAT. I am on 2mg/Day 3 & tomorrow I make another cut down to 1.5mg. My plan is to jump at .13 mgs. I am using the helpmegetoffdrugs.com taper method. Has anyone used this method or know anyone who has found success with it? 

I’m sorry about the rant & cry baby shit. I am no victim, I am just really depressed & it’s debilitating. I am really struggling internally & could use some support. As I don’t have support elsewhere. Thank you to anyone who made it this far. I would love to hear your stories of any kind! 
Sending all my love, B🐝

1356,hbgc2k,"Getting off Oxy with Temgesic. Hello, I live in Latin America and take 360+mg of Oxy IR/day. It is time to stop. I have experience with quitting/withdrawal as I was a former IV heroin user (yes, I got clean off the needle to eventually start using Oxy's like an idiot years and years later.) I have access to .2 Temgesic. A few questions:

1) Temgesic is .2 MG Bupe and nothing else. No Naloxone. Do I need to be in withdrawal before I use straight Bupe? Or does that only pertain to Naloxone?  
2) Can I swallow or snort the Temgesic? I cant do sublingual. I tried with vitamins in the past. I just cannot do it, I will vomit.  
3) What happens if I use Oxy and Bupe simultaneously to taper off the Oxy if it gets out of control? Is this possible?  
4) VERY SILLY QUESTION: .2 seems... so minimal. My habit on a scale from 1-10 is 8ish. I think i would need closer to 16/mg bupe a day. How is .2 even a thing? Is it even worth trying with these? I bought three boxes for about $100. There are 10 in a box. I feel like I'm wasting my time and should just taper the Oxy and go through the shit because I suck and got myself in this situation.

1357,hca4dy,"Cold turkey not by choice. Hey all! I just wanna know what I can do for this debilitating anxiety I’ve been having since being forced to cold turkey. TL,DR at the bottom since it’s kinda long. 

Okay some backstory. I’ve been a heroin/fentanyl addict for about 8 years now. I had almost 2 years clean when I relapsed and stayed out for a year on fentanyl while being on methadone maintenance. I went to detox and rehab and they don’t do methadone so after a few days of pure agony I was put on suboxone maintenance. I was gradually increased to 20mg a day. I’d been on subs for about 6 months at this point when I relapsed on heroin and ended up in detox. I was tapered off the 20mg in 7 days. It’s been almost a month now and my anxiety has been so bad I’ve been unable to function. I can’t eat, sleep, or work due to it. It was so bad yesterday I had to go to the ER where I was given 2 doses of Ativan and 1 of Valium and my anxiety was slightly lessened. However, when I woke up this morning it was back in full force. I’d had a hunch this was all withdrawal effects from stopping the subs on such a high dose without a proper taper, so when I found an old sub in my room I took it (4mg) just to see. Lo and behold it worked. I’m probably going inpatient for my anxiety which is honestly making me suicidal and I’m not sure if I should ask to be put back on a low dose to properly taper or if I should just keep waiting it out until this abates. The only problem with the 2nd option is I can’t function like this and it seems to be getting worse every day. I’m afraid I’m going to kill myself because of it. How long will this last? What has helped some of you when dealing with it? Should i just bite the bullet and go back on? Any help is appreciated. 

Here’s a list of things/meds I’ve tried in the last 3-4 weeks. 
-daily exercise
-daily meditation
-getting out in the sun
-going to meetings 
-calling my sponsor and recovery friends
-propranolol
-metoprolol 
-seroquel
-trazodone
-thorazine 
-gabapentin
-kava
-kratom
-buspar
-vistaril
-benadryl 
-cut out caffeine
-snuggling with my pup
-deep breathing
-repeating different things to myself, ie “this isn’t gonna kill me” “I will be okay”, etc. 

I’m so lost on what to do. Any advice is appreciated. 

TL,DR: I was on 20mg of suboxone and had to taper off it in 7 days at an inpatient detox. My anxiety has been out of control and I can’t keep on like this. I’m afraid I’m going to kill myself because of it. How long will this last? What has helped some of you when dealing with it? Should i just bite the bullet and go back on?

Hello everyone, I just found out that this sub sub exists and I’ve been reading a lot of posts here and have learned a lot already, so thank you. 

My DoC, and why I’m on subs, was perks. I had a 100mg/ day addiction for close to 3 years. I’ve been on subs for close to 2 years now. I started at 8mg and have worked my way down to 3mg/day. I have zero cravings and I credit suboxone for allowing me to live a somewhat normal life. However, I am getting very anxious to get off of subs and be completely clean. 

I am currently furloughed from work so figured I’d take this time to try to get off completely. I brought this up to my doc and he wrote me a prescription for Welbuten (bupropion). Does anyone have any experience with this drug? He said it will help with low energy levels and the depression/anxiety which is usually really bad with me. He recommended I take that and it will allow me to cut my dosage more quickly.

1368,hp4ymt,"Suboxone taper plan 2 years. I have been very worried about my doctors taper plan for me and I want to get some advice whether not I should be concerned. He started me on 8mgs and wants to taper me over a period of two years. I had a 200mg IV heroin habit that was getting worse. However,  the first dose of 8mgs knocked me off my feet. I took soboxone a few times 7 years ago so I knew it was strong and asked the doctor to start me on 2mgs and he said 8. I took my first 8 about a week ago and immediately knew it was too much. The 2nd day I took none than attempted to adjust my dose on my own to about 2-4mgs. At first my doctor told me to stay on 8 but 2 days ago I convinced him that if he would not allow me to take less I was not willing to continue treatment for fear of addiction. He agreed. What sucks is I already took the initial 8 and I had a small taste of the withdrawl and it SUCKED. Im getting more miles on this than H as far as painkilling goes( not euphoria miles ). Here is my question,  will it be real hard to get off 8mgs in 2 years? I hear a variety of answers but im just scared that the doctor only knows theory and may worsen my addiction with this.

4 days later now, stuck to it and continued my Suboxone intake. At 20mg a day and I seem to have made some progress. Been using trazadone, valium, gabapentin, and clonadine to help. Crossing my fingers hoping not to develop a fucking benzo addiction as that would be game over for me.

For those of you who are thinking about putting Suboxone in the rear- 

Get to a place in your life where you no longer feel unable to control yourself. Once you have the strength and willpower to not “go back out”- you might be ready. 

Get your life to a place of stability.  It took 10 years for me to do this. 

If you do decide to jump, I highly recommend the tapering process. Besides the fact that it makes the “jump” easier - it gives you time to mentally prepare for this battle. 

This is, in fact, a mental battle. This is not, however, an impossible feat. Your body will follow your mind, but your mind will fear the body- don’t give into the fear.  Embrace the pain, feel it, revere it, for the pain is bringing you freedom. Freedom from the shackles that Suboxone has ensnared.  

If you believe in you, then you have nothing to fear. It’s never too late and you aren’t alone. 

Good luck, Godspeed. 


P.s I had a couple failed attempts at jumping in the last couple months... I was weak, and caved. 

This time I got rid of everything - no more Suboxone to come to my rescue. 

This helped almost instantly- for it gave me the feeling of absolution, and finality. This time, there is no going back for me. 
————————————————————————


I have been on buprenorphine products for 10 years now. I have had a tremendous fear of getting off them since researching it several years back. 

It manifested in everything I did (the fear). Fear of traveling, dreams of detoxing during incarceration (which I never have been), dreams of having my script stollen.... etc. 

Most days I would wake up with RLS and totally uncomfortable. I wouldn’t dose right away, I would usually wait till the late afternoon. This was because if I didn’t, I’d wake up at 3am with the RLS, sweaty crap- and take an early dose to fall back asleep. 

The minor feelings I would experience in the middle of the night/morning had me afraid of how bad it would get. I could barely make it 12 hours- let alone several days. 

I was fairly stable at 1mg (2mg strips cut in half) for the last year. I had been on 2 then 1.5 then finally 1. I hung out here for a while. 

A couple months ago, I started a simple taper. 1mg .75 .5 .25 then .13 

I had some life stuff going on that I wanted to get past before making the jump so I ended up going back up to .5- then gradually making my way back to ~.13. 

I took my last dose on Saturday. 

I slept well- got a full night sleep. Sunday, I felt the minor symptoms of withdrawal filtering in as the day went on. 

Sunday night, I didn’t sleep but maybe 2 hours- once the sun came up. I was swimming in my bed, pacing in my dark room, took 6 showers! Lol.  

Monday morning, I decided I wasn’t gonna lie around. I decided I was going to redo my back patio with my wife...

My day was Fantastic. Seriously- as the withdrawal crept in more and more...my mind felt sharper, I started feeling more in love with my wife, I started enjoying the tidbits that life provides....

Now we’re here- it’s Tuesday. 

Last night sucked, I got maybe an hour or two of sleep. When I do fall asleep, I quickly wake up in a puddle so 🤷‍♂️- it’s hard to sleep in a wet sweaty bed. 

I got up this morning around 7, did the dishes, made breakfast for myself, and took my pre workout supplement - 

Quick side note: I often drink a very light energy (pre workout) supplement in the morning. It’s called Optimum Nutrition Energy plus Aminos. They make cans you can buy or a powder. This stuff is great. Only 100 mg of caffeine and a huge host of focus inducing amino acids. Some of them are endorphins precursors- I keep wondering if this is keeping me in such good spirits. I highly recommend it- I don’t consume energy drinks, but this stuff is almost too good to be true. 


Once my wife woke up, we decided to work on the patio again...

Now today is much tougher than yesterday. I feel heavy and tired. My body has this Nauseas feeling that I can’t shake- plus the “I can’t sit down and relax because I flop like a fish” syndrome. 

However, guys- I feel fantastic. I mean, I feel terrible but this is not the end of the world. 

If anything, I would rather live like this (minus the complete lack of sleep) than go back to the dull, heavy, mind numbing, irritability causing, motivation sucking, abyss that Suboxone added to my life for a decade. 

Suboxone always ran my life. It was a precursor to every thought I had- and everything I did. 

And it had the effect of making it difficult to enjoy things when I wasn’t in the peak of my dose. 

Movies weren’t as exciting, video games couldn’t keep my attention.. and it was always mood swings and major ups and downs.

Some days I would feel almost “high”.  Other days, I felt worse than before I dosed. Everyday felt sub- life , sub- par. 

I know that I’m not done with this journey. There’s a long road ahead ... 

If I had to gauge things, I would say that tomorrow/ tonight will probably be the worse- or peak- of the physical withdrawal period. 

Because of my super low dose  (which always dissolved in my mouth too quickly and barely made me feel better) before jumping, I went into withdrawals fairly quick- which is what I wanted. I didn’t wanna feel fine because of high plasma levels and long half life- and not start this process till 5 days after cessation. 

I can update if anyone would like. I send you all good vibes and will be receptive to any vibes that I might receive.


Edit:

Here’s my update. 

Night 3 was tough but I was able to fall asleep out of sheer exhaustion and get a few hours eventually. 

Day 4: was fine. No major complaints. Didn’t feel good or anything but no new terrible symptoms. Was even able to go to the grocery store and stuff.  RLS was/ is still been pretty bad- comes in waves of intensity. Just mental hurdles really...","['TP', 'PPE']",0,0,1,0,1,0

Some people are absorbing all the nalaxone and little bup. And some are just dissolving way less bup. Either way, across the board it's inconsistent AND supposedly the half life on their bup is significantly less. Does anyone else feel this way?

The subs were keeping him happy and functioning without cravings. I don’t know the reason , but he stopped taking subs 3 to 4 weeks ago . He has gone from being a kind , caring , and considerate person .... to a monster . He is now rude , arrogant , negative and heartless.

So I’ve searched about every way I possibly could but couldn’t seem to find a straight shot answer or much of anything related other than the beginning and end...I’m hoping someone here with a little more experience can help. I’ll try to explain the situation the best that I can. 

So over the years I’ve battled addiction with oxycodone, and sought outpatient treatment at a suboxone clinic. Going off and on, I think my body has become dependent on the suboxone (go figure). down to about 1-2mg a day trying to taper down I got feeling a little better about 2days going completely without. I believe I basically got over the worst, but gave in and used oxycodone...about 60mg. My question is did I just screw myself back to phase one? And start back over with I guess an opiate/synthetic-opiate dependency? Or will I possibly just be back where I was..lack of motivation, feeling tired, depressed, aching, slight sweating and feeling cold. Nothing too bad...I wish I would’ve just pushed through my urges, because now I’m worried I’ll be back at the worst stages but didn’t know if the body works that quickly.

1392,ie0utb,"What was your withdrawal timeline with a decent taper?. I have literally scoured this sub-reddit even with the Top-All Time setting, in order to find these metrics, timelines and experiences. Some good information, but very scattered. This has to be the most sought out information, and I hope to get some information not only for me but for those in the same predicament.

So, I will start with my experience but since I am one also looking for information, information from all those who are down the line and past my 8 days and such will be better suited to help others, i think.

\*I tapered 5-6 months from 16 mg cutting in half pretty much 1 or 2 months until i got to 1 and eventually jumped from like .3.

\-Days 1-5 were when the restlessness in the day were alive and well but mute, a lot of pacing with all the other flu like symptoms, both mute compared to hard opiates but still there, like 40ish% with the RLS and R Arm S rofl. Not to mention just feeling like i wanted to collapse with a weak body feeling.

Everyone knows the restlessness is the worst so that is kind of the sticking point for this thread.

\-Still for me, on day 8, at night the restlessness is still here and annoying as hell. Its not terrible at all, but just the fact that it arises at night makes it a pain to sleep.

I have noticed that gabapentin is a great medicine for this but FFS I don't want any other withdrawals so I am at that point where i just have to stop that since i am going on my like 6th dose of around 400mg per, all at night since days are mute and rather good now, just sweating and sneezing for me from day 6 to now day 8.

&#x200B;

If you want to include your experience with a jump higher, a jump cold turkey and stuff, please feel free to, I think would be helpful for people in that boat.

Here is my timeline-

1. Days 1-5 were when the restlessness in the day were alive and well with all the other flu like symptoms, both mute compared to hard opiates but still there, like 40ish% with the RLS and RAS (R Arm S rofl) or otherwise known at noodle body syndrome, which i just made up or someone else might have patented that... If i did not have gabapentin, nights would have been pretty bad, but i didn't take gabapentin the first couple days and that's how i know, but i did get 4-5 hours regardless, even without helper meds. But with it i slept great, but that's something that can lead to issues if you take it too long i believe.
2. Days 6-8 have actually been pretty much decent and great, not 100%, more like 85% with the nights still crappy but not extremely bad. I sweat during the day, notice my mind adjusting such as sadness that doesn't affect me since i know whats happening so i just shrug it off and do something i enjoy such as watch YouTube and enjoy sports news. But since i have gaba, i try to go without but end up waking up and saying screw it, i am taking it again since i am still under a week of taking it once per night, around 5 dosing occasions. I am at the point where i just have to not take it at least skipping a night or 2 since i DO NOT want to withdrawal ever again in my life from anything except caffeine.

&#x200B;

\*\*\****What has your timeline been, or what was your timeline when you did a good taper?***

***Since nights are the worst from what i have read the most from you guys, and I agree- When did your nights get better with the restlessness, especially from doing it the right way, a decent taper?***

&#x200B;

And what might be just egotistical, but i think is a wise move: for anyone getting sad and depressed through this late stage withdrawal. TRY and reconsider that sadness NOT as a depression, but more of a clear mind you now have that is clean of obstacles, basically just remind yourself that you are a tough individual and made it farther than most do, something to be proud of! Truly, if you can manage to convince yourself of the undeniable truth that you are improving your life going through this, it really can help you stave off the feeling of uncertainty, which is in your control if you want to harness it (easier said than done for some, but i wish you the best though).

The first 4 months was the worst and one of the best times since being off. The conviction and work up to the taper and getting off, I was very dedicated! Feeling uncomfortable and pushing myself felt so new,

About month 5/6 I fell off to a deep depression and was put on a work leave during this time. My doctor tried me on antidepressants and all that to no avail. I did use medical grade cannabis vape as needed the first 4 months and decided I should stop. Didn't have any fall out from it. But started dealing with the new me after a decade. 

After I got back to work month 7, I had a slip at Christmas on 2 norcos. Then a few weeks later a small amount of sub like 0.25mg. I brushed it off and work was going better and life in January. Had a break up out of nowhere at the end of January and you can guess how that went. Ended up drinking, taking sub, mixing benzos, called out of work 2 days. I had no tolerance and this was dangerous. 

I went to my doctor and therapist as I knew I had to get help and be truthful. My doctors solution was writing me a script of subutex 2mg and taking 0.5mg a day. I caved for 9 days and stopped. Since then I have taken sub every 8-12 days sometimes two days in a row when I was very down for harm reduction...then I just say nope and not take it. Dose was 0.25 pretty low 

I've been in this cycle for a month now. I'm not dependent but I know the gap closes and I've felt it because I'll have minor withdrawls and my day 6 they go away. Mostly mental and slightly crappy feeling. Tomorrow I see me doc who thinks I'm on suboxone...but I'm really not. I just have this fight in me! 

I'm thinking of just making it to Saturday which will be a week of nothing and then giving the meds back to a trusted family member to get them out the house. Suboxone helped me but it also destroyed my teeth, gave me bladder issues and made me so complacent a lot of my 20s went by and now I'm 36. It's easy to justify being on it when you're on it. But justifying getting back on it when you been on it for 10 years is really hard! It has to happen at some point.

I made a throwaway for this cause its kinda embarrassing. This is a question I've had for a couple weeks now and only have one person to talk to about it, and they are kinda slow. ok so I've been addicted to subs on and off for probably 5 years or so. id say about 80 percent of the time I've ever been on subs its been IV. i know its bad. i dont even have a wheel filter. always got off the streets. up until recently finally got a doc for them. so now i get 60 5.7 mg zubsolve pills a month. they say that the 5.7 equals out to being the same as an 8mg sub strip, due to better absorption.

Heres the question:

so... ""due to better absorption"". id think it would be a save assumption to say they are figuring this thinking we are all taking it like its supposed to be, sublingually or under the tongue. we all know you only get like 5.2mg or so (like 65% roughly). so does this mean if i went from shooting an 8mg strip a day to shooting one zubsolve pill, would that mean I'm only shooting 5.7 mg?

I am in recovery from alcohol (among other things), and a friend of mine who is in recovery from heroin is losing her benefits and is talking about prematurely tapering off of suboxone since she won't be able to afford it. She makes enough to keep her from getting Medi-Cal, but not enough to afford the medication out of pocket or to pay for insurance.

My life is going fine, but I feel like it could be going a lot better without them. There are a few ailments that I have, and I'm not sure if they are due to Suboxone or something else. Has anyone ever had any of these things from Suboxone?

1. Introversion. While I've always been the loner type, I feel like I've been more introverted than ever these past 5-6 years or so. I might go out with friends once per week, and I never want to. I spend 99% of my time in my room, working on my business. If I have to go out later in the day, the thought of it ruins my whole day until it's over with.
2. For  men - while we know Sub greatly lowers sex drive, has Sub ever caused you to have problems ejaculating? My semen is very chunky and globular, and this chunkiness causes pain and ruins the sensation. I'm wondering it this is because I only ejaculate a couple times per week due to the lowered sex drive?
3. No energy or desire to exercise. I used to be addicted to the gym and diet. It was a huge part of my life. But nowadays, I eat terribly and lifting is the last thing I want to do. I can't tell if this is due to my age (35), or Suboxone.
4. Very dark thoughts at night and in the morning. At night, sometimes I will just think of how scared I will be once my loved ones die. It terrifies me that it might put me in a depressed state and cause me to turn to drugs again. Once my Sub starts working in the morning though, I am fine.

Thank god for Xanax though. I then began to get restlessness a few days ago in my arms and legs at night. I’m taking Clonidine for it and I think it’s helping lol. 

The last 4 days have been tough. Friday I actually went to my best friends who I hadn’t seen in person in over a year, we always just FaceTime and I even met her daughter for the first time. I stayed there for like, 8 hours. To be able to do that was incredible. I was lazy and did nothing but I was still finally seeing my best friend and her two amazing kiddos. Suboxone has just paralyzed me as far as leaving home. I can’t even begin to explain the shit I’ve gone through and missed out in because I just couldn’t leave home. I also got my hair done on Wednesday which was good, too.  On Saturday, I took a little extra suboxone. Of course I felt better and did so much cleaning. I felt more awake too. One of my top struggles right now with the taper is how tired I am. Then yesterday and today I took my regular 0.125mg. I just feel like garbage. I feel congested, insanely tired, I feel like I even have swollen glands though my throat doesn’t hurt. To top it off, I’m breaking out all around my mouth and the pimples fucking hurt. 

This has me so rundown. It’s been 2 weeks and I feel like shit still. I’m sure it’s normal but it’s frustrating. It makes me feel like I’m just never gonna get off this and be better.

1437,bipu4g,"Methadone to Suboxone - back to methadone? Possible?. Hello all,

My name is Kristopher and this is my first post. I am a 38 year old Canadian male. I mention Canada because I think there are some significant differences in treatment.

I had a small to moderate addiction after suffering an injury in Afghanistan. I left the military and ended up in a methadone clinic. Within a few months I was stable at 90 MG. After three years I had brought my dose down to 20 MG. (hindsight, I should have continued with the taper).

My Doc had been talking to me about methadone to Suboxone and really convinced me that it was the next step in getting free of the weekly clinic visits. And I am certain that protocol has helped tens of thousands - but it is doing me and my family harm. 

When I started the suboxone I actually found it to work ok. I felt the same as I did on the methadone. I started at an 8mg pill, sublingual. Every visit he kept raising the dose - aiming for 24mg. The issue is that every time I went up I was starting to experience some nasty problems. I am so angry all the time. I am treating my family like garbage and I can't stop it. It's bringing me back to a really bad place. Currently I dropped from 2 pills to one (8 mg). This is day three of dropping one full pill. So far I feel no discomfort. 

I need to discuss this with my Dr. and I will on Thursday. I just want to know if anyone has experienced anything like this? That suboxone made them really ""dark""? I hear people use the term ""dark times"" and I totally get it.

Here are my options as I see them. Please highlight any other options if you see any:

** I completely and quickly taper off the subs and attempt life without.

** I stay on the Subs and eventually lose my family if I can't get out of this rut I am in.

** Now here is the best option as I see it, but don't know if an addiction doc will do it: I go back to a small dose of methadone and taper off like I itially had planned (years back before I knew about subs).

I am not sure what other info I can provide to help get me some good evidence based advice, from the people who know more about this than I do. Ask me anything if you think it can help me. 

Thank you for taking your time to read this. I genuinely appreciate it.

1440,vvp33x,"Is there a known way to convert buprenorphine mg/day to methadone mg/day?. I'm considering switching to methadone from buprenorphine 6mg/day. I was on 16mg for about a year and have tapered to 6mg over the last few months.

Is there a way to calculate how much methadone is equal to 6mg of buprenorphine a day? I've found a few sources but the result is not what I expected, so I want to check.

Considerations:

* Buprenorphine's efficacy is not linear.
* Buprenorphine has a ceiling effect. (At 6 mg/d I should be just near that)
* Methadone is a full agonist and has no ceiling so might provide more effective relief because of a wider range of action (?) and so less mg/d are required (?)

When I use equivalency tables meant for pain to calculate the equivalent dose, I end up at about 70 mg methadone/day. This was much more than I expected. I was hoping for something like 10-20mg, 30mg at most!

In another source, I read that buprenorphine's ceiling effect is equal to approx. 300 mg/day of morphine. And that a 2 mg/day bupernorphine is equal to 60-180 mg/day of morphine. That would still put me, using buprenorphine 6 mg/day at around 300 mg/day morphine equivalent and hence 60-120 mg/day of methadone. That confirms my initial findings.

1441,qi2vrm,"Smaller dose feels like more?. So basically I’ve been on suboxone for 8 months now. I started taking pressed 30s two years ago and was on them for a year and then I got a high paying job and was able to afford real script oxys from an older friend. My tolerance eventually built up and I was taking 2-3 pills a day which costed around $60-$90 a day and I wasn’t even getting that high anymore. I decided to start suboxone to try and taper off and it would at least be much cheaper. My doctor told me 8mg would be a good starting dose. She even told me it was a small dose. This is when I learned the doctors don’t actually know much about the drug like most of us have lol. 

I begin taking 8mg everyday in the morning and it was legitimately giving me a nod and felt significantly better than 2-3 oxys. I then started to begin to feel side effects like being zombieish and decided I wanted to go to a smaller dose. I meet with my doctor once and month and told her this on the 5th month. She convinced me to think about it for another month and then we can talk about it. 

Fast forward to month 6th and when I show up to my appointment it’s a different doctor and he says my regular doctor is on vacation and I’ll have to wait until next month to come up with a taper plan. Fast forward to month 7 and I’m ready to discuss a taper plan and she finally started talking about it. She said I should drop from 8mg to 6mg and I will experience withdrawals for a week. Then when she’s writing the prescription she asks me if I am currently seeing a therapist. I told her no and she said she won’t start me on a taper until I do. This then led me to the 8th month where I currently am. I have my next appointment in 18 days. 

So she prescribed me 30 8mg pills and I just started to taper on my own because it seems like she has been purposely delaying the process. And this leads to my question. I’ve been on 6mg for the past 3 days and for some reason I’m feeling much more euphoric and better than my 8mg dose. The 8mg dose used to give me a small buzz in the morning for 30 minutes and then I feel like a zombie the rest of the day. Now I feel euphoric and energetic on smaller dose.

My doctor wants to switch me to subutex but I haven't called yet to confirm pregnancy because im so nervous they will ask me to bring in the rest of my last script.

So I’m sure other have seen my posts from before when I was freaking out, March 10 is the last time I took Methadone 80 mg before I walked away cold turkey after 4 years being on it.  Since March 13 I have been sick in withdrawals and in bad PAWS non stop until last Saturday night when I got 8MG. Subs, I took 4MG in the morning and 4 MG at night for 3 straight day and every time I took it i was high as shit cause my tolerance is stupid low and I started to feel dope and loopy again so I stopped and it wasn’t worth for me.  It did how ever give me 3 days break from twitching sweating and have my brain and body some rest. My question is how long before subs leave my body? Cause it’s now like 30 hours since I last took one and I feel completely fine?  Are my paws going to come back just as bad? Or will I just have to deal with mild withdrawals from sudden stop of subs? Some have said since I broke the cycle of PAWS it won’t be any where near as bad anymore and that I should be fine from methadone withdrawals or subs.

So I don’t know what to think?? Or is this just delayed and I need to wait 3/5 days before it hits me like a TON of bricks again??? Just strange how this all happen, I mean it’s been 2 months since I took any king lasting opioid besides the 3 subs couple of days ago. Anyway I just really hope I’ll be ok cause I can’t take another withdrawal for two months the way it happen before

My name is Rachel, I am a Study Coordinator at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. We are currently recruiting participants for a paid research study looking at a new way to access buprenorphine/Suboxone or naltrexone/Vivitrol in a community pharmacy setting. This is a 3-month study, called the MATPharm study, comparing usual care to a new care approach at 6 pharmacies in Rhode Island. The pharmacies have the capacity to provide telehealth care and the study offers transportation assistance to medication appointments. 

The goal of this study is to expand access to these medications in areas where it is difficult for individuals with opioid use disorder to receive treatment. 

Part of the study is completing interviews and you will receive cash for answering questions about your health and telling us about your experience in the study.

If you are currently prescribed buprenorphine/Suboxone or naltrexone/Vivitrol in Rhode Island, you may be eligible for this study. Please call or text 401-408-6451 or 401-473-9286 for more information or fill out this brief survey and we will contact you:

1462,l54apn,"Tell Your Evil/Corrupt Suboxone Doctor Story. First post in this forum, and I'd like to begin by venting: there are apparently A LOT of corrupt/greedy/straight up evil doctors that take advantage of people with opioid addictions in the prescribing of Suboxone. 

I'll start: 

My first sub doctor was partnered with a therapist who was eventually convicted of sexual assaulting several of his patients as well as trading prescriptions/lying to the courts about those patients under supervised treatment in exchange for sexual favors. 

As far as the sub doctor, the day that I told him I no longer wanted to take subs and was willing to suffer through the withdrawal to get off of them, he proudly presented me to the aforementioned therapist saying, ""We got another one that's ready to get clean!"" The therapist scoffed, responding, ""Well now I can't make any more money off of you."" 

The doctor was later arrested by the Feds, and plead guilty to ""...Prescribing high dosages and large quantities of controlled substances, early refills for controlled substances, and continued to prescribe to patients even though he knew they tested negatively for those substances. He also prescribed in exchange for sexually graphic photos and videos; he also prescribed controlled substances not typically associated with psychiatric complaints, and prescribed dangerous combinations of controlled substances.""

My second suboxone doctor ran what I can only describe as a prescription whore house. He would show up in the waiting room absolutely shit hammered drunk, telling the same disjointed, ridiculous story about opiate addiction again, and again, and again, often times forcing people who had made appointments at specific times to be late by up to an hour. As far as who actually ""counseled"" me,  I never once saw the same person twice; it was a rotating menagerie of various medical professionals who all claimed that any and all insurance companies ""mandated"" the prescribing of Zubsolv, yet the sessions were in no way coverable by insurance (so they said).  The office, btw, was composed of three rooms from an old house in which there were several large tables with the aforementioned medical folks sitting around them. The sessions were conducted in direct earshot of everyone in the room. Privacy did not exist. 

I've heard of other horror stories regarding how Suboxone doctors can be as bad if not worse than dope dealers, so please share yours if you care to.",['AL'],1,0,0,0,0,0

1464,wqcv0j,"Hello folks. I’m prescribed a very low dose of subs to dissuade use, and it’s gone well until the last few days. Now I have a small situation and a few questions.. I’m on 1mg strips (half a 2mg strip), once per day to dissuade kratom, extract and tianeptine use. I realize that is insignificant compared to many people’s situations, but it was initially a higher dose to get past the tia withdrawals, and because I’m currently undergoing a whole series of ECT (Electro Convulsive Therapy) sessions for severe depression and it’s critical that I maintain consistency for the anesthesia to work correctly and predictably. 

I have 2 weeks before my next ECT session, and I’ve messed up the last 5 days and took doses of tianeptine that easily overpowered the suboxone on 3 of those days, and skipped the subs altogether the other 2 days. I’m now starting to experience withdrawals (much more than I expected to experience) and need to get back to my consistent baseline within the next couple weeks. 

My question is, is there anything wrong with taking a higher dose of suboxone for the next few days to get myself through these withdrawals so that I’m able to sleep and not miss work? Would that even work? Would you foresee a problem getting back down to my small 1mg dose after a couple days of higher doses?

I understand and appreciate that I made a bad choice, and that it also likely seems minor to many of you. I’m not sure the best way to get out of this pickle and also make it to work when it’s important that I do so while I can.

1474,fix301,"GENERIC VS BRAND NAME - NEED HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS TO SOLVE ISSUE. How do you get name brand? I get them from an acquaintance who is on Medicaid but  recently started getting generics (Sandoz to be exact). They doesn't notice a difference and thus are not very motivated to push for brand name. We benefit from each other and now that she has been getting the generics and I have been having severe adverse reactions, I asked her to see about getting it changed since I am her only customer and we trade meds. What can be done and how can I explain it simply to her so that she can understand?

On my behest, she apparently asked her Dr. to change it back because she ""felt different"" but he said they're the same (unsurprisingly)...She also apparently asked the pharmacy about getting the brand name instead (I think the Dr. writes Suboxone on her script but she has Medicaid \[of course\] which won't pay the brand name willingly) and they told her that if she was able to pay for the brand name over the generics then the insurance company (Medicaid) would get suspicious of where she is getting this money to buy the brand name is coming from and cut her off. EDIT: It seems there might be some validity to this despite my initial reluctance to believe it. I still feel like maybe there would be a way around this so if anyone has any ADVICE, please sound off below.

Sorry for the digression but the point is, I need to find a way to effectively explain to her how to get brand name at the pharmacy and actually have the doctor do something about it. I am willing to pay 100% of the cost.... I can't speak to lack of pep or anything like that but the last time that I tried the Sandoz generic I got a HORRIBLE fucking headache. It was so freaking bad. And I have atrial fibrillation intermittently and Suboxone used to bother it all of the time but then suddenly stopped which was a miracle because that was a major issue that was preventing me from taking it/staying clean . Anyways, the Sandoz was also causing that issue with me. I literally NEED the brand name and I don't know what to do.

To this woman's credit, she has asked her friends for the brand name to trade or whatever but nobody is getting it anymore. (I have to assume this is because they're all on Medicaid but I'm sure even regular insurance companies don't want to have to pay for it if they can get you something cheaper.) So long story short, I don't know what to do...I'm about a week away from hanging in my car outside a clinic and asking people until I find someone that gets the brand name. (That sounds crazy and probably dangerous but this is where I'm at)...

I'd also like to note that I am probably only at 3mg a day. (I cut an 8mg strip into like 15 pieces and take one 3x a day.

I would just go get it myself but I am prescribed Xanax (which I also need to take once a day to prevent the onset of my heart issues when I am taking Suboxone so it is arguable even more important than the Sub and my psych will cut me off if he were to find out that I am taking Suboxone, let alone a recovering addict.

I have tried to ride this sub train before, but I have never been successful trying do it on my own at home, (just going to the dr., but still keeping it a secret and not getting any additional help). I have made it no more than 3 days the other times I’ve tried. 

The two main differences this time are that my husband knows I am on suboxone, and that I have been going to the groups (virtually online through Zoom). The fact that I don’t have to hide it is huge. The support form other genuine people who are going through the same thing, but are completely outside my circle (they’re from all over the US) has been incredible. 

And even though we are from all over the country, the groups are relatively small and we all have a chance to really get to know each other. I’ve gotten a couple really good suggestions through these groups aswell.

I’m so stoked to actually start participating in life again and feel productive. I have even let go of my pride and begun doing DoorDash. My thinking behind this is that I need to start contributing financially back to my family. My addiction cost us ALOT and on top of that, I also stopped working. 

I have a Masters degree and was top of my field before I let addiction come back in to my life almost a year and a half ago now. I haven’t worked steadily since then. Every time I do a job search, I see so many great opportunities, that I am qualified for, but being that I work in mental health, I don’t think it’s ethical right now to be in a position helping others. I am just beginning to help myself. 

I started doing DoorDash a few days ago and realize just how easy it is to bring in some income that my family can use right now. I am genuinely grateful to be able to do some thing right now to contribute. 

I know that when I have a little bit more time in sobriety I can return to my field and make more money. I will also be more experienced.😐

Actually, this whole circumstance has me thinking about possibly going into addictions.
Whereas I shied away from this population before, focusing mainly on child welfare and private counseling, I now see what a tremendous difference it makes to work with someone who is compassionate and understands.

&#x200B;

So, I used to be on 12 mg Suboxone daily back when I did oxycodone. But for the past half year or so, I started doing heroin, about .5-1 gram a day. I am really eager to start up Suboxone treatment again, considering that methadone isn't an option for me and I feel that I really can't afford to keep up my habit. But my problem is, that I am really scared no dose will work for me, because the couple of times I tried taking Suboxone instead of heroin (last time I'd say about 3 months ago), the Suboxone didn't work at all, if I remember correctly, it actually just made me feel even worse. Those times I took 12-16 mg. I was told by the doctor at the addiction center offering Suboxone, that they were sure the problem just was the dosage, and that that just needed to be upped.

&#x200B;

So what dose do you guys think I should start with, to not feel any discomfort from withdrawals? I, myself, thought of saying fuck it and just start straight on 24 mg, but idk, that's double of what I did back on oxys, but at the same time, my use has also went from 160 mg oxycontin to 1 gram of fent-free high-purity EU #3 dope.

I had a bad toothache in March and an old friend had reached out offering me heroin so I took it. I didn't know anything about precipitated withdrawals until I went to take my sub about 6 hours after the ""heroin"" wore off.

Fast forward to the beginning of August and I had another bad toothache and quit taking my subs so that the fent would hit better.

Well not only have I made it to Day 10, but got through yesterday without grabbing my automated refill order after receiving the text saying it's ready for pickup. All the superficial withdrawal symptoms like the sweats, aches, watery eyes and nose and stomach issues have all but subsided since two days ago. I am still experiencing the whole bipolar body temperature regulation issue and sleeping solidly. But, the one thing that has returned is that I feel naturally sharper. I'm not taking any of this for granted because I have read so many testimonials and even journals online that have said even after months that your serotonin and general happiness doesn't return which is fully understandable. I'm beyond proud because this is one of the longest times I've ever gone, but in closing I am not going to get complacent one bit. Just wanted to post this showing that it is possible to jump off of a dose 2mg a day or higher. Now I'm just hoping that sleep becomes more solid as the days continue to go on because ATM the longest I have stayed asleep at a time for is 3-4hrs. Then I'm usually up for a few hours then maybe can get another couple of hours after that. I have Trazodone that was prescribed to me about a year ago, but the only substance I wanted to use during this jump was Advil for the head and body aches. In closing, if anyone has any natural ways to help with sleep who have also gone through this type of jump?

I was very addicted to tramadol 3/4 years ago, at the end I was taking 450 drops/daily wich was close to the lethal dose I think. Then I went to see a doctor and I started taking suboxone (24mg/daily) I took this amount for about 1 year and then at the end of the last year I started reducing it and today I'm almost close to the end (taking about 0.350/0.400 mg daily).  


I'm having two problems right now : the first one is that it's been about 6 weeks that I can't do workout anymore,( I have an allergy problem, maybe histamine intolerence and doing workout is making me sicker)and the workout was helping me enormously to endure the pain of the withdrawl.  


Second problem is that it's getting impossible to control the amount that I'm taking, even with 2mg of sub it's very hard to cut it with accurency so my daily intake is getting very randoom. Worst my drog store are out of suboxone since few week so I only have 8mg sub remaining wich is even harden to cut with accurency.  


I was thinking that one of the solution could be switching from sub to tramadole, with tramadole (drops) I can control my intake with a huge accurency.   


Do you think it's a good idea? If I do that I should first spend about 48hours without taking sub before taking tramadol right? Also what is the equivalent of 0.350/0.400 mg of sub in tramadol?

Finally made a decision (w/support system, CBT & SMART therapy, subs, good nutrition & exercise) to stabilize and work on myself. Spent a year with 3 relapse (1 time only, not binges). 

Then started feeling like some on here. Suboxone is an amazing maintenance med but after about 6 months on 12 mg a day I felt so stuck and numb in life. Yeah I was doing better of coarse but I knew I was still on a potent opiate. So I decided to start my taper, slow n steady, instead of previous attempts. Most of it was a walk in the park compared to jumping off black/fent or even methadone/high suboxone dose. 

At 2 mg it got real tho. Foggy head, anxiety, insomnia, body aches, restlessness and insomnia, lethargic/severe fatigue, nausea and severe headaches….all that good stuff lol.

So I did an online consultation to get on Bupe after tons and tons of research and obviously a lot of friends going through this over the years. 

I started out on Wednesday morning with 16 mg in the morning and 16 mg in the evening. Some of the research I’m reading now suggests that that’s way too high however I feel like I’m still struggling to be stable.

I’ve recently found out that suboxone is linked to teeth damage. I knew that Methadone and suboxone “caused dental issues” and the link between poor dental hygiene and opioids.

I started suboxone nov2020.  I switched from Methadone to subs at 22mg (i believe). It was a bumpy week or so. In the ten years of Methadone i had my share of dental problems. Mostly because i neglected my teeth while active use. 

While on suboxone i have been incredibly meticulous about my dental hygiene. Since November 2020 i have had 4 extractions, one super complicated that required a bone graft in my sinus cavity because the infection spread so far. I have two more teeth that need root canals (possible extractions) one tooth literally cracked on a smarties candy, and a huge chunk came out. (I don’t eat candy since then so don’t judge me) and one other tooth that has some weird “dentin”  issue that the dentist can’t seem to understand.

I can’t afford the medical bills and the pain is insane. I started my taper last night from 8mg to 6mg.

I feel so emotionally numb when the feeling of subs wears of in around 4 hours(use to last all day at one point). I also find that I don’t enjoy music like i use to. I’m exhausted all the time. I feel like I let people walk over me because I simply don’t care anymore(which is very unlike me).

I’ve been an addict towards stimulants and alcohol, but I went on suboxone for depression because it’s something I’ve struggled with all my life and it’s been the only thing that has actually helped. Not only that but it helped me completely cut out alcohol and stay away from stimulants because it makes me feel better, and even if I do drink on suboxone, the euphoria feeling isn’t there and it makes me sick, so it took that desire away.

Yes I know that being on suboxone for depression isn’t ideal, I regret it now, and wish I could come off this stuff. I am so terrified of the depression that comes with not taking my subs everyday.

I’ve tried this in the past and it has never worked very well but this time it did, without even doing too much dope.

Is it better to keep taking my subs along with the dope until I decide to get off the dope?

Or… would it actually be worse? Because I will already have suboxone in my system that my body is used to. So I won’t have that stepping stone from heroin down to suboxone, it would be like I was just quitting heroin cold turkey.

It usually occurs when I am feeling quite low and I am experiencing those first waves of withdrawals. It’s almost kind of a “beautiful dark” feeling.

example: I was walking around the city and withdrawing from my suboxone taper. My senses felt like they went a little bit in overdrive — all of a sudden i could smell the hot, humid summer air combined with the smell of food from the street carts. I could hear the subway train pounding the tracks in the far distance. the sounds of kids playing in the street. Spanish music playing from the local bodega. It was all kind of beautiful and mystifying— kind of felt like I never experienced this moment before. Or maybe I did experience this when I was 4 years old?

all of this brought me back to past memories of me traveling to the city with my family and experiencing all of these newly discovered stimuli. Almost like to a time where I felt like the world was brand new and I felt safe and secure.

I got down to 0.75 mg and for *years* could just not taper any lower or I would experience the worst withdrawal symptoms-especially depression.

Anyhow, I had surgery a few months ago and I was required to take antibiotics for a week after. I was also supposed to increase my dosage of suboxone for pain relief.

I found that the combo of the antibiotics and increased sub made me feel so sick and out of it that I actually *decreased* my sub intake-down to 0.125 mg…and I felt *better.* No withdrawals, *nothing.*

I have maintained that dosage of 0.125 mg up until a week ago (I did try increasing my dose to 0.25 mg-0.50 mg, but all it did was make my lethargic and not feel well.

That they feel very low and lost alot of their personality? I use to be very humorous and felt more loving with my partner where as now I feel very flat. Lowered sex drive and lost alot of my sense of humour.

Would subs (Buprenorphine) be causing this? If so does anyone know why?

I have a theory and it's just that... A theory.

Buprenorphine has been shown to partially agonise the mu opioid receptor and in turn releases dopamine. Over time with this continued use the dopamine receptors become down regulated. Now we do release dopamine but the receptors are so down regulated that we feel the usual low dopamine symptoms. Low mood ' Low sex drive' Zero drive in life.

I may be completely wrong but it seems a reasonable idea.

1750,wscg91,"Coming off Suboxone the right way. So I’ve been taking suboxone 8/2 mg strips since January and recently started my taper. I began to feel like the side effects:
-insane perspiration (sweating)
-low sex drive
-insomnia and trouble sleeping 
-afternoon crashes (like crashes on steroids)
-constipation 

As well as others weren’t worth it. So I went cold Turkey. I got to a full 72 hours and couldn’t take it anymore and took about a quarter of one. That got me going for a few days. I’ve settled on a maintenance dose of 1mg (1/8) every day. I’m getting my drive back and not sweating as much and am sleeping much better without needing an afternoon nap. Here are some things I’ve learned. 

-cold Turkey isn’t the way unless you’re totally without and have no choice. Don’t do it to yourselves 
-it’s about 2/3 as has as full opiate withdrawal 
-be patient. You’ve been taking this medication some of you for years. Don’t expect to come off in a month or less. 
-clonodine is a great alternative and excellent anti anxiety pill that will help you come off 
-expect your cravings for opiates to return and learn to fight them. If you can’t or don’t work any sort of program, I’d strongly recommend staying on the medication on at least a maintenance dose
-listen to your body. If you’re at 1mg a day and need a little more, there’s no shame in taking a little extra. 
-please, if you can’t abstain from opiates, keep taking suboxone and accept it’s necessary. It’s better to live on suboxone then to die with dope.

1761,wrn0e1,"“Pay the piper” and other common phrases with addiction. Recently, I have seen a few posts using the phrase that someone “has to pay the piper” at some point, whether it is going through withdrawal from the person’s opiate drug of choice or eventually tapering off of sub and going through sub withdrawal. I have never thought much about the phrase until another poster pointed out that the phrase gives the false implication that everyone deserves to pay via the pain of withdrawal because of our struggles, choices, and likely shitty behavior at times. After I read this, I agree with this point of view. I don’t think the disease model of addiction is correct (it is too simplistic and inconsistent), but, I think a medical analogy is appropriate. I mean we (society) never tell cancer patients they have to “pay the piper” when they get really sick during chemo treatments etc. So why do opiate addictions deserve pain? Thoughts?

I know there are a lot of other sayings and phrases associated with sub and addiction that I think are harmful. Another one the really bugs me is “people are in denial or just aren’t ready for help” these are false because people deal with fear, anxiety, barriers, etc. but the phrases are just more “victim blaming” which is bullshit. Then with sub specifically there are things like sub docs are government sanctioned drug dealers or sub is the governments generic heroin etc. I think all these catchphrases just had to shame and stigma (external and internal).

The subs worked well for my bone pain. 
I had chosen to come off this, because I had several other medical conditions. 
Plus I was also addicted to benzos and stimms.  While being dependent on subs.  
With the help of my doctor 👨‍⚕️ I did an inpatient treatment, and ketamine infusion for a week. Treatment has been successful so far, and I have not used benzos or stimms. 
I have another ketamine infusion booked for 02/09 earliest I could get in.
But my pain has become unbearable, I have had another bout of shingles and also covid.
I have tried some painkillers targin and oxy pills.  They don’t work very well..

1787,wqaico,"Suboxone tapering schedule. Hello, I’ve posted previously but I’ve calmed down a bit now and have more questions .
I’m doing better (anxiety wise) . I’m really trying to plan out my taper.  28 days ago, I started tapering from 16mg. I was experiencing severe anxiety and panic attacks out of nowhere.
I’m  was put on lexapro during the same time.  

I have been on Suboxone for 3.5 years.
Due to fear that the Suboxone has not been at all helping the random anxiety/panic attacks or even causing it -I am tapering.
Even if not, I hate that I can’t just stop when I needed to and feel trapped on it. I used to love it :( .

I really am feeling better. Not 100 percent, but close.  

I’m taking a 10 day “vacation”  the first week of January to “jump”(the longest I can take). 

I’ve been reading a lot, but I really want to make sure 4 months is enough time before I put in for it. I want to alleviate PAWS as much as possible. 

Does anyone have long taper links? I have tapered to 6mg and will stay here until the end of the month.  I want to have it written/planned out .

1801,wprv9l,"Needing advice on going from 8 to 4mg.. I searched the sub and didn’t find a lot of definitive answers, but I also know it varies from person to person. 
I told my doctor that I was tired of feeling so apathetic with no drive for life anymore and that I was ready to taper to at least find out if the apathy is better on a low dose. I’ve been on 8mg a day for a year, and he told me to go straight to 4, (then eventually straight to 2 and then we would slow the taper down.) 


So 4 days ago I dropped to 4. The last 2 nights I only slept 4ish hours, I’ve had a dull-but- throbbing headache for 2 days, and today I woke up at 3 am with an upset stomach. Add in some general body pain/muscle cramping that was totally bearable and a little extra yawning/nose running on day 3 -and that’s the extent of it. 

I guess my questions are: •will I “stabilize” pretty soon at 4mg and possibly when?  The headache is pretty annoying, and I would prefer 8 hours of sleep, but otherwise I’m not miserable for sure. 

•is 4 to 2 going to be rough? (I have a pretty decent stash of backup from taking half of what I was prescribed the whole time Ive been on, so I can slow my taper down if needed without him prescribing more, but just curious) 

•bonus: does the apathy/loss of motivation/drive/emotion get better at low doses?

1802,wpnhg3,"UM. I can feel Opioid despite Suboxone?. Ok. Someone is gonna need to give me some education.

I’m on 6mg of Suboxone, divided into 3 x 2mg doses daily for 5 years.

I have a dental infection against a branch of my temporal nerve that hasn’t responded to antibiotics. As such, they haven’t been able to freeze the tooth for extraction and have referred me to an oral surgeon.

So I have QUESTIONS:

First, out of pure desperation, when Torodol and Tylenol, I thought I would see what if anything would happen if I took 5mg of oxycodone - expecting nothing, but willing to try anything.

Now, it’s not as strong as it might have otherwise been, and I would say the biggest difference is that it isn’t really “euphoric”, but I’ve caught one heck of a buzz. Maybe more than a buzz. Like, that “haze” feeling opioids give? Got that. Big time relaxation. Pain relief. And, my respiratory rate is a little different. Nothing too serious. I hope. It’s been about an hour since I took it. 

But, HOW?! It’s 5mg for god’s sake. This makes ZERO sense based on EVERYTHING I’ve read. Tell me how this is happening. I wouldn’t call it a “pleasant” high, but it’s at least having some of the desired effect, but it’s pretty WEIRD.

Second question - the dentist suggested Lyrica but then did an interaction check and said that it was a major interaction with Suboxone. He said I could double check with my pharmacist (which I intend to do), but wondered if anyone else takes Lyrica/PREGABELIN, not for withdrawal but while on a full dose of Suboxone? Ideally for pain. It would only be 25mg. Any issues? Does it work for pain for you? Any advice/insight?

Yesterday, after 4 long years, I had the pleasure of telling my Doctor that I had successfully tapered since January and no longer required anymore Subutex.

He was shocked and pleasantly surprised that I made it through without any medical assistance. This place taught me everything I needed to know on how to successfully taper. My Doctor was unaware as I never wanted to rock the boat in the event that I relapsed.

When chatting with him, I had explained that the negatives had began outweighing the benefits with Subutex and that I decided to make a real effort to taper and eventually get myself clean. 

By the end of the appointment, he tore up my script and congratulated me on my hard fought battle to sobriety. 

Walking out of his office felt so damn liberating. Knowing that I no longer had to visit him anymore regarding Subutex, and that I was now walking out of there for the final time was a great feeling. I felt so damn proud of myself you would not believe!

Thank you to everyone here that supported me on my journey. Without this community, I could never have learnt how to taper before eventually making the jump. This place has truly been amazing.

I am on Buprenorphine. And I am experiencing some extreme peripheral oedema. It started as soon as I took Buprenorphine. It is so extreme I yell out in pain when I am getting changed, moving, sitting, trying to get into bed. Making my life a misery and my doctor will not listen. It is extremely frustrating. 

I take it sublingually. And because the BNF states that it’s not a side effect she won’t give me the time of day. 

However, it is listed under very common for

Parenteral use 
Transdermal use 

I am in agony. I need something to go back with as I need off of this and onto something else. Can anyone help? Is it possible to have the same side effects with a drug, even though it’s administered differently?

I'm metabolizing buprenorphine too quickly, I keep having to raise my dose. It stated happening after I attempted the accelerated detox from the Coleman clinic. In order to speed up the detox process, they give you micros doses of Naltrexone everyday, it puts you in precipitated withdrawal but supposedly pushes you through the withdrawal period more quickly. So instead of it taking three to four weeks to complete the acute withdrawal phase, it only takes 10 days. I was unable to complete the detox, it was too painful and I quit on day six (which I now regret). 

It's an expensive procedure, but I'm thinking of trying it again. I just want to know if anyone out there has completed it? If so, how was their experience? Was it successful? They told me eventually once the dose of naltrexone got high enough, the shots wouldn't cause as bad of a reaction (the precipitated withdrawals wouldn't be as bad), is that true?

I am writing this because I need your help deciding when to make the jump. I want first start by saying that I love and appreciate all of your comments.

I have been on .375mg for 4 days now. Will it make a big difference if I jump off now or should I stick with my original plan and taper down to .03mg in the next few weeks before making the jump. I have clonidine, zofran, and clonazepam for the W\D. I am taking the clonazepam sparingly though so I don’t get re addicted. I was previously on Valium for 2 years and tapered off 1.5 years ago.  Any help would be greatly appreciated! I’m also wondering how bad the withdrawals could get; will it mostly be painful poops, nausea and back aches?

1891,wge5jx,"Anyone gone from prescribed Subs back to prescribed Oxycodone?. I've been on 10mg Subutex (suboxone minus the Naloxone) for almost 4 weeks, which was prescribed by my pain specialist - prior to this, I was on 50mg daily of Oxycodone. Unfortunately the side effects of the Subs have been extreme, with headaches, nausea and sedation. The pain relief has been so-so, but to get good pain coverage I have to take the Subs as 2mg doses every few hours - if I did 6mg mornings/4mg nights as initially prescribed, the pain relief was crap (suboxone's analgesic properties only last 4-8 hours). 

Due to the side effects of the Subs, I've been unable to work or study, and my hobby of piloting small planes has also been canned for the entire duration of the Subutex treatment. Basically, life has sucked.

As a result, I'm now being rotated back on to Oxycodone, but my specialist has only prescribed me 15mg per day. The plan is to stop taking Subs on Saturday night, take nothing on Sunday, then take 3 x 5mg Oxycodone on Monday. Looking at Morphine Equivalence, the amount of bupe in my system equates to 200mg per day, so I'm extremely concerned I'm going to go into withdrawals.

Has anyone here had the experience of going from Subs back to traditional painkillers such as Oxycodone or MS Contin? Is 15mg per day going to be enough to stop withdrawals?

All physical & mental symptoms have subsided. I sleep well, I eat well, no depression or anxiety. Sometimes I feel unmotivated or exhausted - something I didn’t feel ON subs, but I can usually get out of the funk pretty easily nowadays. I remember to give myself grace and push myself when I can, and life is going to be fine. I just finally feel like me again, the good and the bad. I wake up everyday and do life, rinse and repeat. I often thought about suboxone almost everyday, not that I wanted to take it or anything - just that it was always on the back of my mind. How long it’s been since I’ve been off, how I’m feeling as a result of getting off, etc… and I don’t anymore. And that’s a blessing.💓

The first month was hard, the second got better but was still difficult, the third and fourth it got increasingly better. And now, I just finally feel great again and it’s such a relief to know that suboxone is a thing of my past.

A bit of background is I ended up in the hospital 6 days ago, I was using opioids and benzo’s mainly but a lot of other drugs and alcohol also. I had some withdrawal symptoms but nothing too severe or unbearable and I think the majority of the withdrawals were related to benzo’s. 

The doctors were really pushing for me to start suboxone because my goal is to go to treatment I. The next few weeks. So I started on 4 mg, 2 days ago. I felt pretty unwell the first day I was nauseated, sweaty, confused and dizzy. I would go from being completely exhausted to rambling to my nurse about anything and everything (felt like I couldn’t stop talking).   The second day on and off I felt a bit of nausea, a head ache and a bit sweaty but a lot less confused and out of it. An hour ago I started 6mg and I’m feeling fine so far just tired. I’m a bit nervous about Suboxone overall. The doctor recommended a dose between 8-12mg. I’m scared I’ll won’t be able to get off of it, but the doctor said that at a dose of  8-12 it would probably take about a month to stop. 

My question are; is it common to feel sick when you’re first starting?

My husband is the ONLY person who knows of my past addiction and my subsequent (successful) recovery. I don’t share outside of Reddit and my husband because I feel recovery and talk of MAT is almost as stigmatized and looked down as addiction itself when it’s something that should be celebrated (imo). 

I wonder if others feel this way, too.

 So I can only imagine an increase from .5mg to 2mg. It being an increase Four Fold. This just screems overprescribing.

My boyfriend is a recovering heroin addict. He’s been sober from heroin and oxy for 5 years. 
We have been together for 3 years, and we’ve celebrated his sobriety anniversaries together. He has always promised me that he would never lie or hide anything from me. 
I found a text message on his phone from some random guy asking if he wanted “strips”. That is when he came out about being on Suboxone for 8 years (prescribed and for some reason that I can’t articulate - from this random guy).
I’ve been doing research about suboxone. I understand it’s an approved medication for individuals who struggle with heroin addiction and to refrain from using. My boyfriend has a stable job and does not have a history (since I’ve been with him) of lying and or using. 
He says now that I know he’s ready to taper down. But I can’t help but feel that maybe that won’t be a good idea. I told him to do it slowly if he really wants to but that he’s not obligated to if it’s kept him stable for so long. He’s seeing a doctor next week to come up with a plan to taper.
I just don’t know how I can trust him. How do I know if he’s relapsed? How do I know why he was buying it off the street? How can I be a supportive partner while he’s tapering? Is it a good idea to keep tabs on the amount of strips he currently has?",['TP'],0,0,0,0,1,0

I just got the sub script from QuickMD. (Thanks for the recommendation btw) I’m gonna be trying the Bernese method of suboxone induction. I’m sooo nervous. So so so nervous. I want this to work so bad. I need this to work. I can’t keep living like this.

The last thing I want is for something to go wrong, and then have to go through precipitated withdrawal. I know if that happens I’ll relapse back on the stuff hardcore, and that could potentially overdose me.

Another thing I’m worried about is when I get to the point that I can no longer feel the fent, will I feel withdrawal symptoms? Because if I do I will definitely try to over use to compensate that feeling and I’m afraid I’ll take to much and overdose. So many concerns. So many issues. I’m so scared. What do I do? How do I know this will work? How bad will the withdrawal symptoms be, how long will I have to deal with feeling the withdrawal symptoms.

Ugh…..what do I do?! Why did I even start this again. I hate this shit. Someone told about how some doctors will try to get me onto a short acting opiate before I move to suboxone so I don’t have to deal with the weird fentanyl pre updated withdrawal time table.

Its been a minute, I hope everyone has been staying safe and healthy. I have a question if anyone might have some insight on this topic...

So I relapsed for about 4 months now. Been on the ""blues."" Ive been wanting to get back on subs but it hasnt been easy...but after being sick over and over I am just going for it. I am doing a version of the ""berenese"" method, but since I am on a severely limited budget, I'm having to experiment...

I only had enough for 5 blues. So tonight, I cut an 8mg strip into .25mg increments and what ive been doing is taking one of those pieces every 2 hours or so. So in the last 12 hours ive dosed about 1.5mg of suboxone whilst smoking the blues as little as possible. No discomfort, just some mild sweating but its been ok so far. My question is this, when I run out of blues I should be up to about 6-8mg if timed correctly...am I going to be ok to just start taking subs after this or what??

This is the quickest induction ive heard of anyone doing, but it aeems to be okay. Will the bio have occupied enough receptors to replace the fent?? Prior to these 5 pills, I was sick as a dog and off the blues for the 2 previous days, so in a perfect world there wouldn't be too much fent in my system before this.

Anyone have any thoughts on this? As I approach the last couple pills I'm just praying that I'm gonna be ok to stay on subs, with no pwd. Please, for the love of god, tell me I'm good! Lol.

Started with a back injury and oxys, then eventually moved on to heroin. We’ve been together for 6 years, and he’s relapsed 3 times because of the back pain he still suffers from. He’s got a disc out of place that presses on his sciatic nerve. The first time he started on suboxone treatment and did that for about a 8 months (started tapering at 6). The second relapse he just stopped cold turkey and went through the withdrawals. After the 3rd relapse he tried to do it cold turkey but we had a newborn and it wasn’t doable so I suggested suboxone again. This was about 2 years ago. In August/September of last year he started trying to taper off again and got down to 1.25 strips from 2 strips. He was fine, but then randomly after a month of this he started having withdrawals. His doctor suggested he move back up to 1.5 he did that for about 2 months and then boom, withdrawals out of no where. He ended up going back onto 2 strips and was fine until the end of June. He wakes up every morning in complete withdrawal around 4-5 am. Then at the end of the day by 8 pm, he starts getting chills and experiencing minor withdrawal symptoms (so about 15 hours after his morning dose). At the beginning of this month his doctor suggested 2.5 strips. This relieved the evening withdrawal symptoms, but he still wakes up in the morning an absolute mess.

Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I'd be announcing to everyone here that I've now been Subutex free for 30 days, but somehow, I've managed to see little improvements each and everyday since making the jump.

As for the physical withdrawals, the first 14 days weren't anywhere near as bad as I thought they were going to be. That being said, I jumped at as low a dose as possible (0.100mg) and followed this great [GUIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/suboxone/comments/ornhf3/easiest_way_to_get_off_bupe_without_getting/) by u/Gad_Music so I was well prepared in advance.

Overall, the hardest part for me was the mental rollercoaster of good and bad days. Days 15 to 21 were where I really struggled to lift my head off of the pillow and face the world. The mental fatigue was awful, especially for someone like myself who always feels guilty laying around the house doing nothing with my day.

With all that being said though, my energy levels are improving, the mental fog seems to have been lifted and my overall mood is slowly improving day by day.

So i switched over to the oxy , about 100mg per day every a.m. at the same time i'd take my bupe usually.

I guess my question is, should i just try to taper down to .125 by reducing my 1mg dose in half every few days or something or should i switch back to maybe a lower dose of oxy for a few days and then take maybe .5 mg of bupe when i switch back?

2105,w4hh5d,"5 Days sub free!. Curious to see if any of you could give me some advice..
For context, I had previously abused oxy, vicodin, and pressed fentanyl “30s” for about two years. Like most addicts, I got tired of feeling like trash, blowing all my money, and having no overall care for my own well-being. I enrolled in a local MAT clinic and began using suboxone daily (4bup/1nax) for another year & 1/2. For the most part I had a good experience with the medicine, but decided to start my next chapter in recovery and put the subs down as well. I was able to taper down to under 1 mg.
Now, onto my coming down experience. Days 2-3 were the worst in terms of soreness and anxiety. Luckily I didn’t have the stomach issues that frequently come with stopping opioids. From that point forward my body has felt fine and I’ve even been able to get in the gym and complete some high rep work outs. What has really made this process most difficult is the insomnia/RLS. Obviously I’m still very early into this process, but the lack of sleep is driving me nuts. I’m exhausted, but my brain will not shut off. I was wondering if there may be any OTC remedies that could help with this. I’ve read that phosphorylated serine could be quite beneficial in comparison to Benadryl/Melatonin that could make the RLS worse. THC/CBD are also options, however cannabis has only provided me with a few hours of relief & then the benefits start to subside.

I skipped the morning dose and was going to take 2mg only as a test but I’m nervous because I have no WD symptoms except for feeling hot (which is also the side effect that when intense causes me to have relapse issues, plus I live in the middle of a jungle but I have air conditioning). 

I know OPs are time release and I’m shocked that I’ve had so few symptoms. With the fent cut black tar I waited roughly 24 hours and was good. Am I okay to take subs?","['CDU', 'MA']",0,1,0,1,0,0

I filled them the 1st of July I  got 28 strips im now out. My doctor knows I take a little more than prescribed here to there. The reason for my post is I was reading that people usually can get them 2-3 days before they run out. My script would equal tomorrow that I would run out. I take 2x 8mg strips daily but sometimes I cut off some of the 3 rd one depending on how I feel. The pharmacy when I called today said tomorrow I can get them because that would equal the 14 day supply. Just curious is there a reason why some pharmacy allow early refills and some don't? I did learn my lesson about having back ups now.  My doctor said she would have prescribed me a higher dose but because I drink didn't think it was a good idea.

Today is day 17 of my taper from 2mg down to 0.125mg. I tapered from 2 to 0.25 in the first week, which was mildly tolerable (87% total). The following 10 days of taper from 0.25mg to 0.125mg was a much greater challenge (94% total). 

I finally arrived at 0.125 a few days ago, and at this point, the dose doesn’t really even take the edge off. Today, July 13, is the day I chose to commit to kicking the subs. Well, I’m here now and today is the day. 

I have some comfort meds: methocarbamol (muscle relaxer), hydroxyzine (anxiety/insomnia), and mirtazapine (depression). I’ve done a ton of reading into these medications. I plan to take just the methocarbamol and hydroxyzine tonight to help me sleep. 

I plan to push myself through this, but I know my limits. The biggest challenge the past couple of days has been difficulty sleeping and mental fatigue. Luckily, I am in a situation where I can be absolved of all major responsibilities for a week or two. It’s kind of like a ‘now or never’ type of thing, though.

My only problem is that the film tends to get stuck on the finger when trying to get in place, and if you don't get it in the first try it starts rapidly liquefying on my finger and it sucks if I mess up part of my daily dose.

I haven’t been on subs for over 4 years, but I’ve made the decision to temporarily re-induct to get me by. I have a few 8mg strips that I cut down to 1mg doses. I’ve been taking 1.5g kratom to scathe by, but I think it’s time to just ride the sub train for a few days. 

If I at least waited over 12 hours and felt like shit but only had Kratom dosings. Would I be good to induct 1mg sub? I know for a fact I can’t make it to the 24 hour mark. What are my options?

2246,vwpomc,"Gabapentin, Clonidine, Diazepam - How long are you meant to be on these comfort meds after making the JUMP?. Hey folks, 

So after spending 7 months tapering down my Subutex dosage slow, I kept reading about all the benefits of Gabapentin, Clonidine, and Diazepam. These were the 3 comfort meds recommended to make things that little bit easier along the way. 

Today will be day 15 and I've I'm still taking both Diazepam and Gabapentin. Today, before work, I took 10mg Diazepam and 300mg. On my lunch break, I took another 10mg Diazepam and another 300mg Gabapentin. 

Obviously, the last thing I want is another addiction to another drug. Both drugs seem to be working as I've been sleeping like a baby, and I've hardly had any issue with most common WD symptoms including RLS, Hot/Cold Flushes, Sleep Issues, etc. 

We all know how addictive Benzos can be. Luckily, I only have a 31 day supply @ 10mg per day. That'll run out quick enough, and I don't plan on buying anymore. 

How does this work? Do you keep it going until you feel 100%? Should I run out the 31 day supply of Diazepam and call it quits after that? What about the Gabapentin? I've still got a whole bunch of 300mg pills, and I've been told, if I continue taking them for long periods, I may experience WDs from them too. The highest dose I've went in one day is 900mg Gaba, so I'm not going overboard. That being said, popping pills daily can get addictive no matter what the drug.

Last week I gave myself 36 to 48 hours of not taking anything to take the film and within a half hour I started sweating bullets, feeling sick as hell.

I never really had a true opioid addiction but after a tragic life event and with already existing depression, I started taking low dose opioids in order to keep up with my career. They completely obliterated my depression without euphoria as long as I kept the dose low. 

Eventually I knew I would become addicted because I was requiring an increase in dose to keep the depression at bay so I went and asked for a buprenorphine script. The buprenorphine did exactly what the opioids did for my depression. I felt normal for the first time in my life. 

Anyway, I recently decided to taper off and to start Stablon (tianaptine) because I’m moving to a country where buprenorphine will not be prescribed the way it is in the US and Stablon is an available antidepressant. I thought, my opioid receptors seem to be involved in my depression so maybe Stablon will work for me but it didn’t or at least it was making me so sick to my stomach that I could stay on it longer than 6 days. 

I horrible and didn’t want to go through withdrawal while awaiting another buprenorphine prescription so I took a nibble of a 30mg oxycodone that I had sitting around for years. It was surprisingly intense and I’m glad I don’t have more because it felt great. 

My buprenorphine script is ready now so I’m wondering….

I too roughly 10mg of oxycodone about 35 hours ago. Before that, I’d stopped Stablon for 4 days. Am I safe to introduce .5mg of buprenorphine? My stomach is a mess right now so I assume I am withdrawing a bit.

I would prefer to still feel like me… just 99% less tense and panicky. Just want to breathe..

I have never tried kratom or valerian root. But I am at a point where I would try just about anything (preferably nonaddictive) to get over the debilitating anxiety I have been experiencing lately.

I was researching a little bit about kratom and I always see people talking about it. Have never tried it myself. I can’t find any info on using it WHILE being on suboxone. Is this because of an interaction or because it’s dangerous or something? 

I was also reading about valerian root and wondering if anyones had any luck with either of these and any info you can give me would be super helpful.

I decided to ditch the oxy and try subs back in May. My oxy habit was 100-120mg a day and I was put on 4mg suboxone. I didn’t have any cravings or anything. I haven’t slipped even once. My provider moved me down to 3mg where I’ve been for a week.

I just spent the last 9 days tapering down by 50% daily, until I reached 0.25mg, which I’ve been taking for the past 4 days (before bed). The first night on 0.25 was horrific. I barely slept. I had awful w/d symptoms for the first three days on 0.25mg/day. 

Yesterday, I finally had the first glimpse of ‘feeling normal’ since the taper began. Last night, I was reluctant to take my dose at all because I was feeling the best I have so far. I ended up taking the 0.25, or if anything, slightly less. 

I’ve been anticipating jumping off ever since I began the taper. I’m currently wondering, if maybe now is the time to do it. Alternatively, I could try dropping down to 0.125mg, maybe try that for a couple of days and then perhaps jump from there. 

I just still kind of feel like shit today. I have very little motivation to get any work done. I kind of just want to get it over with so I can finally begin to return to normal.

Last week, I stopped taking them for a total of 4 days and used fentanyl.  It was def a decision I regret.  I looked up the burnese method of induction, where a person maintains fentanyl use for the first few days while microdosing suboxone and slowly building up their tolerance. I am on day 4 of microdosing sub at 1mg so far today.  I have not used fentanyl in 2 days. No withdrawls of any kind! 

My question is if I stop taking the suboxone, will I experience a terrible withdrawal? I may have issues getting a prescription bc of a potentially dirty UA and I have been long to stop using suboxone to break my reliance on the use of daily opiates.

Has anyone ever substituted an opiate for another opiate and only used the new, substitution opiate for a few days and abruptly stopped? I don't care what opiate it is, I just want to know if this theory actually works to stop all opiate use without experiencing withdrawl or at least making them tolerable enough to be able to fully quit.

I'm a dedicated meditator and I have been meditating on a variety of drugs, and ofc without them as well. I've noticed that suboxone really change my thoughts in a troublesome way and wonder if anyone here has experienced something similar? 

Let's say I meditate and I experience thoughts related to my current life situation: I worry about my job (for example) then I take suboxone and the worry dissipates and is being replaced by an interesting daydream. Pretty normal and expected effect, but what happens if I am on suboxone 24/7/365...?

I'm curious what people's experiences have been with taking these and/or other meds for chronic constipation due to bupe? there's lots of research on their use for full-agonist opioids, but as we all know, bupe behaves a lot differently!

I know that kratom can also be addictive, but isn't it a natural product? What are the long term effects of kratom vs suboxone? If I'm going to be addicted to something, which one is worse?

And for those that say kicking kratom is the hardest thing they've ever done - were you also previously addicted to opiate pain killers or opiates/street drugs of any sort? If so - which was harder to get off of, subs or kratom?

I've been taking 4 mg suboxone 1 time per day for the last 4 years. Any time I went without, the withdrawals were unimagineable, with days 3-7 being the absolute worst. I found this thread and after reading the pros and cons, I decided to stop Suboxone and take kratom. I was honestly scared to death of withdrawals but I'm on day 4 of no suboxone and I'm absolutely amazed at how normal I feel. I am not feeling any withdrawal symptoms whatsoever. 

However, I'm not a fan of having to dose 3 times a day, I'm used to taking my 1/2 sub pill once a day and that's it so this is already becoming quite a task, and a messy one at that.

1— GoodRX Gold is a complete scam. Do not pay for it (for subs anyway) They advertise that you can save up to 90% a month for a $5.99 monthly subscription fee. After you enroll and pay the membership fee the prescription actually ends up costing MORE than it would with the GoodRX Standard coupon. Sometimes up to $25 more. For example the standard coupon was $108 last month and I was charged $116 for ""Gold"" *can show evidence of this if anyone's curious*

2— CVS continuously inputs the wrong codes charging me an arbitrary amount. At least every other month. I present the STANDARD coupon for the afformentioned reason and they will still ring it up as Gold and it will cost more. As a recovering addict it goes without surprise that finances are not my strongest skill and it's quite disheartening to have budgeted X amount to be charged whatever the CVS technician decides they want to charge me that month.

And I've always been a very unsocial person, but I feel like taking it I become even more introverted (to the point where I'm not just quiet but I really don't like being around people). 

I'm now on such a low dose that when I bring it up to some ppl, they think such a low dose (I take a very small cut off piece of a tab) shouldn't really cause any of these side effects. I'm wondering if these effects make sense?

Also, I was never someone to binge food at night but I find myself doing that on suboxone (even this tiny amount).

I had a bad overdose in early 2021 (after being on subs for a long time and finally getting off of them for the same reasons) and since I'm back on them but it's hard to tell what's from the subs and what might be from the overdose itself (it was pretty bad).

I’m afraid of the withdrawals and want to do it as comfortable as possible. I went to a detox in April and am going to get Suboxone from a website.

Need some help and guidance during my next step in the taper process.

Short background:
I was on heroin between age 15-21 when I got on the first sub program in my country. I wouldn’t be a live without it and I am grateful. 

It’s been more years on it then I want to admit and the latest year I have been tapering as I want to quit.

Currently on 1-2 mg (started at 24 mg).

I am looking for everything I can do and to make the PAWS phase & beyond as easy as possible.

1) should I jump off from where I am now?or should I taper lower? Any experiences that can help is greatly appreciated.

My doc says jump from 2 mg but in my country the experience they have isn’t great and I see best practices in other countries differ so I am leaning towards going lower before I jump.

2) Supplements, food and water intake?Exercise, meditation, hell I even try some all out there stuff IF it helps :).
 Any stacks / plan that helped?

3) what to expect? Do I need to take a sick leave more then a week? Or is it doable to get back to work you think after a week?

2513,vhfqa4,"Why do some people think there is not a ""blocking"" effect from buprenorphine under 2mg?. I've heard this thrown around quite a bit. A lot of people say suboxone doesn't even have an opiate blocking effect at 2mg and under. I've even heard some people say that number is 4mg which I know for a *fact* is not true. 

What are people's reasons for thinking this? Do you think it's because *they* specifically were able to get high after using just 2mg? Because I know even at 2mg, I would have a diminished effect from my dope when I did it, and definitely really diminished effect from lortabs/percocets. Currently I'm at about 1 or usually 2mg of suboxone a day, sometimes 3. So I'm like right at that apparent ""no blocking"" zone lol why do people think suboxone doesn't block opiates at 2mg and under? Because in my experience it definitely does, just not as much. 

On another note, what do you think the MME of buprenorphine is? Most sources I've seen say either 30 or 40 MME; that 1mg of parenteral buprenorphine (which I guess means IV/IM or subcutaneous/subdermal) is equal to about 40mg of oral morphine. And I take them sublingually, so I think that's like 50% bioavailability or something, right? So 1mg of suboxone would be equal to about 30-40mg morphine/hydrocodone or 20-30mg of oxycodone. Does this sound about right to you guys? I'm thinking of just getting back on a short acting weak opiate like lortabs for the end of my suboxone taper, since it's easier to kick hydros than it is subs ime.

2555,vf8x84,California Prisons are pushing suboxone on anybody with any kind of drug use history.. So I went to prison I did 16 months for having 30 g of heroin on me. While I was in prison I noticed everybody was doing Suboxone so I tried it. Liked it and decided to get on the program.  I started noticing people that they were putting on it that didn't need it. one guy was asking me about it and if you he should get on it so I asked him if he does any opiates he says no he only smokes meth so I said then no you probably won't benefit from it it would just be a worse addiction. Two or three weeks later he told me they called him in there and suggested he be put on it even though he told them that he doesn't use opiates and this happened to many others there was even one person that got called in there when I was getting my dose upped and he had no idea why he was getting called in there so when we were leaving he was telling me they were trying to put him on Suboxone and he doesn't even use drugs he said he used to smoke weed as a kid but they're recommending he get on Suboxone it just baffles me that they're doing this it's kind of f***** up. They are also offering 6 months off of your sentence if you get on the medication so there's also many people doing that.,['CDU'],0,0,0,1,0,0

As someone who sniffed suboxone/subutex for like….12 years (yah I have a nose of steel, and it didn’t get fucked up til I snorted generic last year) I’m used to it kicking in and reaching full effect in a relatively fast 30-45 minutes, which is still kind of strange given the immediate nature of most insufflated drugs. 

Now when taking them orally I can’t tell if its a difference in when is the last time I ate, how dry my mouth is or what, but it seems to vary as to when I feel relief. Sometimes I’ll take my usual dose (a half a pill) and not really feel like I’m getting rid of all withdrawals and I’ll redose after like….2 hours….and then maybe 3-4 hours later feel like I’ve taken too much get a light nausea or drowsy. No doubt orally it takes longer to kick in but 3-4 hours seems a bit long for it to peak.

2602,vcindx,"Recently started a telehealth program to better my life and have a few questions.. I recently decided I needed to clean my life up. I’ve been an addict for going on 15 years. After about ten years I went to treatment and got clean for a year, before thinking oh I can control my addiction this time, foolish of me to think. Anyways I got back hooked for another 3-4 years and am finally ready to try and clean my life up again.

I believe I’ll need Suboxone maintenance for a very long time, and not having it after my initial inpatient treatment is why I eventually fell back into addiction. So I did something I had never done in the past - tried to get on Suboxone to maintain, instead of chasing the next high like I’ve done for nearly my entire adult life. I saw Ophelia as one of the first options on google and noticed they had a plan for people without health insurance which is what I need. 

I read it was $195 per month without insurance and realized that was doable for my budget. However during my enrollment call I was informed that the $195 didn’t include the Suboxone itself and after researching prices in my area on good rx about $600 per month was the best I could find which isn’t possible for me. However, the generic film was much cheaper and once again in my budget.

My main questions are:

1. Have you heard of Ophelia and how do you feel about their program?

2. Does generic Suboxone work just as well as the name brand version?

I don't feel like explaining why I don't want it, but I have my reasons and I'm bad at saying no so already, seeing him is stressful bc of that. Now I just got a text with a link to ""digital therapy"" that ""the doctor expects you to enroll in before your appointment"". I have my own therapist of 13 years, well before I ever saw this doctor. I don't want another one. And the website says it's specifically for opiate addicts. I don't want to sit and talk about my addiction,  cravings, shit like that. I've maintained clean urine and sobriety for years. I contacted the receptionist who sent me the text, explaining I already have a therapist and if he's gonna require this, I'll have to find another doctor, and she wrote ""You can discuss with the dr at your appt"".. Then the next text was the fucking URL for the website again. I do NOT want to do this.
I guess my question is, do you think it's worth trying to explain to him why I'm not interested in a second therapist, or should I seek out a different doctor?

Anyway, my question is about other people's experience with Suboxone tolerance. Over the last year, my doctor has been increasing my dose. I started the year at 2mg and now I'm at 16mg. I was never using a very high dose of opioid when I wasn't on Suboxone, so my tolerance wasn't that high, but my experience with Suboxone has been that—just like any other opioid—over time I build a tolerance and start experience withdrawal symptoms at any given does. If I understand tolerance correctly, my brain just adds more opiate receptors, so any dose I take it just.. adapts. I'm currently at 16mg, and I've started feeling mild withdrawals (on the COWS scale) in the afternoon before my second dose, and in the evening a few hours after the second dose. Is this in my head, or am I getting a tolerance? Is there a ceiling to this process, or do you just increase your dose forever?

 Opioid receptors are also present in the intestine. When Suboxone activates these receptors in the intestine, it slows down movement and the operation of bodily systems such as the excretory system, muscular system, lymphatic system, digestive system, and more. This can cause constipation. Refer again to Can Suboxone Lead to Addiction for more on the retardation of movement and bodily systems. The stagnation causes material (feces) to remain in the system for longer than it should; this, in turn, causes constipation.

Went for med refill today and my doc hit me up with trying Suboxone. I didn't contend with him too much because tbh, Norco's no longer help as much with the pain, and just seem to be a major problem keeping them on hand anyways. Tired of feeling like I ""need"" them just to get going in the mornings. 
But, I also know that I have been taking the Norco's long enough that to come off of them is going to make me feel sick for quite a while. He says the Suboxone will help with my pain much better, because I won't have that hangoverish feeling if I ""don't"" take them. 

But I am very worried about what kind of pain levels I will be left with and very worried about withdrawing from the Norco's. 

I am reading that you have to wait 72 hours or some such before starting the Suboxone, but he said I could start at 13 hours if I only take a half one at the beginning. 

Anyways, any info or help to alleviate my fears and anxiety would be very appreciated. Do y'all think I will have a hard time switching over? And will Suboxone really help with my actual pains?

I finally decided to stop getting my Sublocade shots after being on it for 16 months (and two months of oral Suboxone prior to that). The main reason why I wanted to get on Sublocade was because I heard how much easier it's supposed to be to quit than any oral form of buprenorphine; I knew I'd never willingly taper Suboxone, because I've tried it before, and it's miserable. I'm one week out from when I would have gotten my most recent injection, and for the most part, I feel fine; however, I've been having intermittent symptoms that feel a lot like withdrawal.

Tuesday night, I started getting fidgety, I was yawning nonstop, eyes watering, nose running a little, and I had terrible nausea that only went away after taking promethazine (prescribed to me by the NP at my rehab place, among other comfort meds for coming off the Sublocade). Then this morning, I woke up and I was freezing, and a touch of that nausea was back; normally, I'm a little bit warmer than I'd like in my apartment with the thermostat set to 74, but this morning I was shivering.

Anyway, before I make this any longer than it needs to be, I just wanted to get an idea from the community here about whether I might be experiencing intermittent withdrawal symptoms, or if it's something else somehow that I'm interpreting that way.

I was (am, only in title/reputation) a professional theatre practitioner for the past almost 20 years. 

When I first started Suboxone, I noticed a dip in my creative output. Ideas weren’t fully realizing themselves, I lacked motivation, I found I couldn’t emotionally connect in the same ways I was used to.

I chalked this up the dysthymia, and to an extent I still do, but I can’t help but feel as though the Suboxone itself is as responsible  for the dysthymia as anything else.

In the years since I’ve been taking Suboxone, the above feelings (or lack thereof) have only become heavier and more intrusive. I used to be able to fight through the muck, but in the past couple years, I haven’t been able to muster anything. Hell, I have trouble just being an AUDIENCE to creative works - I find the lack of emotional connection and my lack of focus to make films almost impossible to watch unless they don’t demand anything of me intellectually.

My doc started me on Vyvanse to help combat my chronic fatigue, my inability to focus and to perhaps even lift my mood slightly, but I would say the results have been limited.

It totally fixed my stomach problems/chills/sweats/body aches, which I’m so grateful for. 

Today is my 2nd day on subs and although physically I feel so much better than before, I think it’s making me feel really hazy/depressed mentally? 

It’s just my first time feeling really “medicated” and it’s making me feel uncomfortable and not like myself.

It’s kinda freaking me out because it’s the only relief I’ve felt from WD in days, but I don’t want to make myself feel so uncomfortable mentally all the time.

Basically what the title says.  3/7 days a week I just can’t even get up on time and end up either missing work or my kids miss school. I am like a zombie for the first 2 hours after waking. Can’t keep my eyes open and can easily convince myself that missing another day of work or the kids missing another day of school is ok. WHICH IT IS NOT. 

I am unmotivated, easily distracted, I get sooo hot, like sweaty all day. I feel fatigued, lethargic and procrastinate things I shouldn’t. 

Before the relapse(s) that landed me on subs, after previously being clean for 7 years, I was the total opposite. Up early, overachiever, was working full time and in college full time for 5 years straight. Most of my kids had perfect attendance and honor roll. 

So like what is affecting my motivation is also affecting their quality of life and their school performance. Ugh. If Moms not right, then nobody is… at least that’s what it seems like. 

I am thinking it has to be the subs. Because they keep me up all night and tired all day. I Get these random moments of clarity where start getting everything back in order and I have the motivation to get back on track for a few days, but then I can never follow through after a day or two.

2788,upj907,"Tapering from Different Opioid Instead. Ignoring the addiction side of things for one second, does anybody have any first hand knowledge or data regarding whether or not switching from Suboxone to Oxycodone (or similar) is easier than tapering from Suboxone itself?

From my experience, the most difficult thing about Suboxone withdrawal is the length of time it takes to feel better. And while Oxycodone was more acute (barely), it was over in a week. 

I feel like being able to know where to finish line is would make an oxy taper easier. So, if you made the switch and then started tapering, and assuming you got low enough, would it be easier do you think?

I am aware that someone will want to say “if you could taper off oxy, you would have done that”, but that isn’t true in my case. 

The problem is, other than not knowing if it WOULD be easier, is equivalency. If I taper Suboxone down to 2mg and switch over, how much am I switching over to without going into withdrawal? And how long to wait?

I know this isn’t the best way. I am considering Sublocade, but for some reason I’m afraid. Or can’t make myself believe all the success stories.

Since then I have done two to three weeks at each drop ; roughly 20-25% at a time  . Currently at .5 for for 10 days and can’t seem to get adjusted . Symptoms include nausea, RLS , broken sleep, agitation , negative impact at work and personal relationship , total inability to be productive , lack of energy and motivation etc .

So far I have tried :
Am full .5 dose - result normal during the day ; things start to turn by 3pm ; miserable by 5-6 .. up at 3-4am for withdrawals.
Am .25 PM .25 - sick all day but sleep improves slightly 
Am .25 noon .125 evening .125 - same as previous. 

Basically I’m debating continuing the taper ; or just jumping if I can’t stabilize . I’m in no rush but if I jump I can be stabilize at 0 in 3/4 weeks vs . Months waiting to stabilize ( if at all ) at these lower doses .

I can’t believe I used to like this feeling. Now I feel nauseous, drugged… not good.

2833,ujv758,"Buprenorphine Wafers? Purdue? WHAT?. While we already have multiple meds available for treatment there will soon be a new kind of ingestion method . Currently, we have dissolving films, tablets, injections and implants. So, how is the buprenorphine wafer different?

It’s all about speed.

Unfortunately, misuse of addiction treatment medications used in MAT is a problem. Therefore, drug makers are working hard to find new ways to stop this abuse of treatment meds. A new and novel approach is the fast dissolving buprenorphine wafer. Instead of taking minutes, this new med may dissolve in less than a minute. It is possible that it will melt away even faster, maybe even just seconds.

How does this help?

In many clinics, patients take their Suboxone or Subutex while being observed. They put the meds under their tongue and wait. Unfortunately, some patients sneak around like dinks and hide the tablets or taking films out of their mouth to misuse later. It is possible that an opioid addict could try to inject these tablets tho so there's that to be worried about . Because they were already in their mouth, this practice can lead to serious infections. One issue is that the patient has more opportunity to sneak the tablets out of their mouth when it takes longer for them to dissolve.

&#x200B;

The fast dissolving buprenorphine wafer.

If the wafer can dissolve in just a few seconds, there is far less opportunity for the patient to divert the meds out of their mouth. The wafer will quickly dissolve and the meds safely in the patient’s system. All this information i have summed together yet I have no flipping clue what mg they will be assigned to or if they are even going to continue this kind of research and or put into operation for patients.",['MA'],0,1,0,0,0,0

My wife and I are doing well in life (she is 100% healthy and never had a drug or alcohol in her life), we have enough substance to start having kids. But we are concerned because I’m on suboxone treatment for kratom addiction subsequent to opioid addiction. 

My question is: Regardless of sperm count itself which may be affected by prior thc or current suboxone use, would there be anything necessarily wrong with my sperm itself? Like would the suboxone cause my babies to be defective somehow?

If so, I obviously want to wait until finished. But it could take a long time to be off subs… I’m scared of that. 

I’m 33. My wife will be 28 this year. We’re ready for babies. But I don’t want to put the babies at risk if there is something physically wrong with my suboxone sperm.

My taper is going better than expected. I was originally at 8mg, then dropped to 6mg every other day, then finally 6mg every day. There was definitely some negative side effects and symptoms but once I got down to 6mg daily for a few days I stabilized and actually felt great.

The reason I did this was because things were going well, and I have family coming into town soon and don’t want to do a drop when they are here. I don’t have a strict plan for my taper, just going by how I feel and trying to be a bit aggressive. I think once I get down to a smaller dose I will go slower.

2941,u8w3wa,"Sublocade taper. I've had several hundred patients taper off buprenorphine over the past 15 years -- most after at least 3-5 years on the medication.  Most have done well, but now and then I'll read or hear about a death by overdose of a former patient.  Tapering is possible, but it isn't for everyone.

Lately though I've been using Sublocade as a 'last shot and done' approach.   If you look at the data, it looks promising.  I wouldn't recommend it for people who are still taking over 8 mg per day, because you would need 300 mg of Sublocade to avoid withdrawal the first month, and the drop-off in blood levels is steep enough to cause withdrawal after a few months...  but when a person is down to 4 mg or less, I can give about 50 mg of Sublocade, which then tapers itself over a year.   Studies of higher doses show the blood level constant for about 8 weeks, then gradually falling to zero at about 52 weeks at a constant rate of decline.

This is my 5th time on a suboxone maintenance plan and I'm ready to be done with relying on a medication that causes so many negative side effects. I'll have a program and meetings/sponsor alongside the taper. 

If anyone out there has successfully utilized a 45-day taper and stopped taking subs completely I'd love to hear how it went

2974,u3vuwc,"For pain management?. I’ve been on suboxone for about 15 months. Started at 16mg/day for opioid dependency. During the 15 months, I’ve kinda fought the process and going back and forth with whether I want to be on them or not. 

About 8 months ago, I tried to quit cold turkey. After 4 days, I took 2mg. I didn’t even really feel a withdrawal to be honest, I just felt like it’s probably best to just take my meds like I should. But I worry about dependence so I started just taking 4mg 2x/day, cutting my dose in half within 4 days.

I’ve been talking to my doctor about the chronic pain and fibromyalgia pain I struggle with and he brought up that buprenorphine can be used for chronic pain as well. He said for pain it’s most effective when dosed 3x/day, so I’m guessing he meant it would bump me up to 12mg/day to start and increase if needed. Now my doctor is apart of a major hospital in the US and accepts insurance and everything so it’s not a clinic or anything. But part of me feels like he’s pushing more on me to keep me on the stuff forever. He’s probably just offering potential solutions.

I personally have never noticed any pain relief from my suboxone doses, even at 8mg 2x/day. I think the only time I’ve ever noticed any effect from my dose is when I first got prescribed and my first 2 doses made me feel kinda out of it. But maybe it’s because I’ve never taken it with the intention of pain relief?

And if you don't wait long enough or talk/smoke while the film is under your tongue then it's not going to be as effective.
    A great solution I've found is to stretch the film before putting it under your tongue. Yes stretch. Grab each end of the film with your thumb and fingers and stretch it out like your stretching play dough or something to thin it out and it will stretch just be careful it doesn't break in half.

You call them 

Fill out some paperwork via email

Either buy your own drug test or they'll have one to you in the mail in a couple days.

Text a video with the results to your provider

Get a call from your provider

Pick up your subs from your preferred pharmacy.

Afterwards you attend 3 zoom meetings for counseling per month and talk to your Dr once a week and send results of drug tests (they send 3-4) and that's it for me so far.

This time around I've kept it much lower I was able to stay at .5 or 1 for months then worked my way up to 2 then a few 4 days near the end (which is why I started to taper). Now I'm suffering.

I'm looking after some feedback about using weed for reducing the symptoms of the withdrawl and making the tappering more bearable.  


I went from 24mg to 2mg and the last few days the restless legs syndrome was so hard (other symptoms was painfull as well) that I had few very hellfull night.  
   
It's been I think almost 2 week that I'm stabilized around 1.90 mg or 2 mg so I don't understand why only the last days was so bad, also I'm tappering seroquel (Quetipin) as well, but I only used to take 25 mg (actually 100mg but went from 100 to 25 few month ago) and it's been more then a week that I started stoping it, so I don't understand why I'm having so bad symtoms right now, but it's not the topic.  


I really think that weed can help me to reduce most of the symptoms (restless legs, nausea, depression,mood, anxiety, insomnia ...) but It will be really helpfull to have some feedback about it.  


If you used weed for your tappering, when did you start using it and how much did it help you?Where you only smoking before going to bed or earlier in the evening, or even during the day?

I see a few of you have had issues not being able to get your meds & a few had no issues getting it. I called Publix where he gets his Rx filled & the pharmacist said they haven't heard of anything regarding Alabama no longer filling telemedicine Suboxone scripts. 
For those of you that had problems getting your prescription filled, what pharmacy were you using? Has anyone else called their pharmacy to check on what they know about Suboxone & telemedicine restrictions? Has anyone in Alabama gotten their meds this month from Bupe.me without any problem? If AL pharmacies won't fill the Rx, can it be called into a pharmacy say like in GA & be picked up from there? Just curious about options.
I am praying he won't have any issues getting his meds & luckily if there is an issue we've got insurance so he can go to a local doc if needed. I know that isn't the case for everyone tho.

Advice- if you have subs or especially other opiates in your home with pets make sure that you have Narcan spray. You can totally Narcan a pet. Maybe they couldn’t even die from the amounts I’m dealing with now but it’s a fear of mine.
Edit: I’m hearing that Narcan won’t work for Suboxone and maybe my research skills were not up to par in this case.

So I’ve been on Sub (mostly Subutex) for way too long, I’m currently tapering down and I am down to ~2mg per day, when I originally started tapering down my digestive issues eased off significantly and I was feeling the best I had in years, but now it seems my body has simply adjusted and I’m dealing with the same issues I’ve had for years which is serious constipiation that is debilitating and beyond consuming. 
I have a VERY active job and I’m moving and lifting stuff for 10 hours or more per day and walking 8-15 miles per day, I have very low body fat and can’t seem to gain weight despite eating a lot. 
I recently started taking Metamucil which seemed to help dramatically the first couple weeks but now idk. I drink at least 10-16.9oz bottles of water per day and I take miralax before bed. I do use the bathroom daily but i rarely get “all the way emptied” and my gut just moves sluggishly so I end up straining which makes things worse in the hours/days to follow…
So all of that to say, if I switch to Kratom (tried it before but can’t recall how it treated my gut) will I regain my “poop reflexes” lol or be able to use the bathroom easier without as much constipation? Or will it be basically the same? Worse? I really want to kick the sub but I can’t risk worse constipation because I’ve had blockages before and it is not fun at all lol

There is a huge demand for this and I'm curious as to why more doctors /providers have not brought on their own dispensaries/ pharmacies so they could provide home delivery for the appropriate patient of course (when you're first starting out you may need a little bit more accountability and structure.) Not to mention we have all these problems with the pharmacies and pharmacist. You could still meet with your doctor every 3 weeks and then that would allow the 4th week for delivery. The doctors could control the delivery date by utilizing FedEx ups and I'm sure we as patients would be more than happy to absorb the shipping cost in exchange for Reliable delivery.

Her confidence is being completely destroyed.  She has been told that the cost to fix her teeth could easily exceed $40,000.  In my opinion, the drug company has a responsibility to these people (paying high prices already for this medication) to warn them or at least give clear instructions on how to protect their teeth while not interfering with the medication's efficacy.

My plan is to go down to 2mg for about 10 days, then do 1.5mg for a week, 1mg for a week, .5mg for a week or 10 days, then jump from there.

When I jump I'll still have 60 klonopin to ease my symptoms. I might also take a  .25mg every couple days at first to ease it but this is my plan, I just want to be through this awful chapter of my life.

I'm going to take two months off of work and just feel like crap and take care of myself while I get this all out of my system. I have a good support network and am not in a position where I feel worried about relapsing, I don't even know where to get h here.

The goal used to be to make the program cheaper then get free suboxone for all members then he did a Non professional study,got over 5,000 patients and now sends his secretary on a cruise once a month while people struggle to pay his fees. Seemed like they cared and were helping, but now mr smith seems to only want to help himself be known in the medical field which i know from previous experience is not easy, but he shouldn't make all of his patients look like followers of a mad man and be laughed at like he will if he keeps his antidote self made science up. Do his patients feel safe and comfortable ? Do you guys realize that he's using you as lab rats? You do realize that the guy you call your Hero could have died with blood levels like that.

3204,t8tm9t,"Urine Test for WA State Job question. Hey guys. First off thanks to everyone here in this subreddit. I'm mostly a lurker but have gotten a lot from here.


My question is I need to pass a UA for a job I recently was offered. I'm going to call the HR person to ask about company policy today but wanted to know your guys' experiences. I have no idea what they are going to be looking at for pass/fail. I use Suboxone and Marijuana (which is legal in my state.) I'm honestly more worried about the companies Marijuana policy than its Suboxone policy. Really my question is have you guys ever had Suboxone come up in a job application urine test? I assume because I'm prescribed it will be a non-issue but that could also be up to the employer's discretion. 


I apologize if this has been asked before, when I searched I mostly saw accounts of people talking about their Suboxone prescriber UA'S and whatnot. Thank you all!

3260,sv3b3a,"Need advice on my situation. Hi Everyone,

I have gone through the vicious cycle of using, going on suboxone, taper off a few times over the years..

I am someone who has horrible side effects on suboxone, though it keeps me clean and functional I am a miserable zombie on the stuff.

This last time I tapered off at .25mg  about a month ago..

I am really struggling, I can hardly do my job or concentrate and relapsed once a few days ago (took an oxy)..My brain just can't function at all, I feel useless at work(and that my boss with notice I'm not doing anything)  and still having intense cravings

I am scared I will go through this vicious cycle all over again :(

What are my options for someone in my position alternatively to suboxone? My psychiatrist mentioned something called ""naltrexone"" that may help someone like myself whos been on minimal dose of suboxone (I was on 1mg for months before slowly tapering off)

can anyone speak to if this might work? or what my options might be?

I am really scared that I'll have to go back on suboxone and be miserable again, I'm sorry don't want to be disrespectful because I know it helps alot of people and it helped me but the side effects make me deeply depressed.

Any advice or feedback would be so appreciated! I am just having such a hard time functioning clean and scared","['CDU', 'PPE', 'TP']",0,0,1,1,1,0

I hate this because I wish I just used it to come off the heroin and didn’t continue to take it non stop. Anytime I think about stopping and cutting the dosage completely off, I just think well how the hell am I going to do that when I’m only on a few MG’s and it’s going to be up for days sort of thing because #1 I won’t ever be able to fall asleep, #2 if I do take like a sleep gummy i will be addicted to those and that will force me to sleep meaning I’ll still probably be unable to fall asleep but even more tired and miserable / or have horrible nightmares

I guess my body is getting good at metabolizing 8 mg subs faster during the day. Don’t know. I tried added in 4 mg after dinner and that unease or need for something feeling goes away.

1. Should I keep taking 4 mg in afternoon or evening? I want to be dropping my dose and not increasing it. I’m afraid if I take 12 mg daily for too many days, my body will adjust to it.

3361,sexwhk,"Down to 1MG - A Reflection. I've been slowly tapering with the help of my wife administering the medication. Having someone control the medication has helped me avoid those moments where I would take an extra strip.

I originally thought I needed 2MG in the morning and 2MG in afternoon to survive the day but through this taper I have adjusted without much discomfort. I haven't had sore legs, bowel movements or much depression. The biggest issue has been only getting about 4-5 hours of sleep and then jolting awake to bits of anxiety.

My goal is to be off the medication completely by December 31, 2022. I feel no reason to rush it since that may just lead to having to go back on the medication later.

I'm scared to go below 1MG but am ready.

I see an extremely diverse, unstructured sequence of a lot of visions/mental imagery, all completely unrelated to one another. Also thoughts are totally unstructured. It's the same as with nodding off when taking a high dose of oxycodone or heroin in the past. The thoughts/images are intrusive in the sense that they can't be ignored easily. And it feels scary because ""they are not my own thoughts"". They are so random. It's very unsettling when you can't control this. As if having extremely vivid dreams while awake. Not good dreams but not nightmares either, just completely random stuff, while the randomness does make it a bit scary.

For me personally rehab, detox, 12 steps, cold turkey, prayers, threats, breakups, and employment issues never seemed to work for more than a week. Suboxone and moving away 1000 miles is what worked for me. I include moving away because I really feel removing myself from the accessibility of Dilaudins (my DOC) and not having connects allowed me to continue Suboxone.

3429,s3t6ln,"How long were you on suboxone before you started to taper?. I know everybody is different and depending on your history, different approaches, timeframes and methods work for different people. However, I’m curious how long some of you have been on suboxone on a stable dose before safely attempting a taper.

The reason I’m asking this and to provide some background: I’ve had problems with opioid abuse for about 12-13 years. Each time after a period of prolonged abuse I’ve entered a maintenance program and I think I may have either not remained stable long enough or tapered too quickly because I’ve always relapsed within a few months after tapering. This has happened with methadone once and suboxone twice. My longest taper was over a 5 month period after 6 months stability.

The reason I don’t want to stay on suboxone is because while it does help me stay sober, it’s always given me a sort of tiredness and brain fog that can sometimes be quite distressing and debilitating.

I’m currently at 8mg and have been stable for 6 months. I plan on remaining at this dose for another 6 months and then tapering as slow as possible over a one year period; how realistic is this? In the past I think my problem was setting a fixed “end date” and then jumping, regardless of anything else. Perhaps not setting a target date and taking as much time as possible is more sensible.

A lot of what people experience, both physical & emotional, is not officially researched or documented as a side effect of bup. People mention feeling burnt out, flatlined, depressed, apathetic, anxious or insomniac. Some might mention opposing symptoms like being hyperstimulated. Of course people have physical complaints that go beyond the expected constipation. In fact, a lot of research into novel side effects comes from scientists mining anecdotes on the Internet and publishing an analysis.

my other option was to switch over to kratom (if it will even help with the wds at all) for a couple days then hop on the subs, as I don't know what these are pressed with and I've heard the norfentanyl metabolite can cause issues for days but idk if that's gonna be a problem or not as I don't know the analouge and how it metabolites.

3467,rz6v91,Freaking out - Pharmacy Screwed Up. I guess this is just me venting but please feel free to offer any advice. I’ve been having issues getting my prescriptions filled the past few months because my prescribing PA doesn’t have a supervising physician. My doctors office swears they don’t need it but our states licensing board and all the pharmacies disagree. They had me switched my pharmacy (again) to try and get it filled. But now the pharmacy they withdrew the prescription from (CVS) is saying I picked up my medication and that I won’t be able to fill it until February. I haven’t even stepped foot in CVS today and they told me themselves they couldn’t fill it. The new pharmacy received the prescription but said they won’t know until Monday if the February pick up is reflecting on their end. My pick up date should be Monday but I think CVS messed up when withdrawing my prescription. If you have any recommendations for a good Telehealth clinic please let me know.

3480,rxzgx8,"Anybody ever heard of Suboxone micro-induction for fentanyl addiction?. I ask because I am considering doing this and, if possible, I would like to hear from someone who has done it or knows a little bit about it and can maybe answer a question or two for me.

Basically, I would take a *very* small amount of suboxone but continue using fentanyl and slowly increase the dose until it totally blocks the opiates I'd start with about  0.125mg on the first day, 0.25mg on day two, 0.375mg on day 3, and so on until I can comfortably discontinue my fentanyl use. Apparently, patients are not sent into precipitated withdrawls from this because the doses are so low. -- In the studies I believe the patients were started at 0.5mg but I want to start as low as possible.

The reason for choosing this method over the usual method that one would normally use for heroin addiction, is because of the fact that fentanyl is absorbed into the body's fat cells in the same way that marijuana is. This causes it to remain in your system for a lot longer than traditional opiates normally would (usually 8-12 days from what I've read) so even if I were to take 8mg and *only* do so after waiting until fully in withdrawls, I would still go into precipitated withdrawls.

For those who have never heard of this method, it was used in a study done by Penn State as well as Rutgers. I will happily include links in the comments once I figure out whether or not links are allowed on this sub.

I was taking a mixture of oxy, morphine and other opiates pretty much daily for the second half of 2021. Not my first rodeo, I’ve used for similar amounts of time and got clean, but always ended up getting back into bad habits that lead to dependency/addiction. You know how it gets.

Anyway, I was doing it in secret and my gf discovered my stash, told my parents and there was a bit of an intervention. I came completely clean to them with all my substance abuse. Usually I’d go cold turkey (with some comfort meds admittedly) but it was 3 days before Christmas so I didn’t fancy spending Xmas eve, Xmas day and Boxing Day etc. in bed.

Over time I acquired some sublingual subutex tablets because I just knew something like this would happen. So this was my taper plan:

Day 1: 4mg 

Day 2: 2mg

Day 3: 1mg

Day 4: 1mg

Day 5: 0.5mg

Day 6: 0.5mg

Day 7: 0.25mg 

Day 8: 0.25mg (today)

So what sort of WDs can I expect? I know the long half-life and stacking effect can delay them and tbh, when I dropped down to 0.5mg I started to feel some minor WDs (worse back pain than usual, diarrhoea, slight brain fog) but largely I’ve been okay.

Brief background: Tried Vicodin at 15, instantly fell in love. Graduated to OC 80s by high school, but never became dependent, simply because I couldn't support the habit

Was shown how to smoke black tar in college, and that was game over. Been struggling big time ever since. Developed a really bad dependence in 2015 which I went to rehab for, and amassed **6 years of clean time**. Never used any kind of maintenance therapy.

Covid happened, enter relapse. 

My entire 2021 has been nothing but relapses. I think I have relapsed 6 times this year, and I just keep failing despite the efforts to stay clean, at times, I feel like I simply cannot. I feel like I have lost control of myself, and literally cannot keep from texting my dealer and picking up.

I've never seriously considered getting on Subs until now. So here's my question to you:

What has your experience been like with subs? Pros/Cons? Would you recommend I go on them, based on my situation? Honestly at this point, I'm not even opposed to being on them for long term. I am much happier when there are opiates in my system.

My boyfriend has been on subs for about 5 years now. He has slowly been tapering down over the last year, which is great. No pressure from me, I took him as he was so no issues there, I’m proud of his efforts no matter what. 

That said, he has no sex drive whatsoever. None. From my understanding, this stems from either prolonged opiate use or current sub use, so at this point there’s not really a light at the end of the tunnel. A healthy sex life is incredibly important to me and this is killing me. He is the first partner I’ve had after a 15 year sexless marriage, so it’s been a tough thing for me to try to overcome. I am incredibly sympathetic and I understand, but it’s also very difficult for me and I’m feeling like I’m at the end of my rope here. 

Is there anything that can be done to improve his sex drive while he’s on subs? I’d never ever ask him to stop taking them or force anything upon him, I don’t even really bring it up to him because I don’t want him to feel even worse than he already does about it so I am just really hoping there is something out there that can help him (and me!)

2 things though, you need to not be in the lifestyle of drug abuse anymore and you need to want it and know that being clean is better than being a slave.

I jumped at 0.4mg after a long taper. I did take a couple of smaller amounts over the next 3 days or so then had enough.

The worst thing was the insomnia and restless legs, but after 2 weeks (sounds like ages but in reality it isn't) it was all gone.

I have my life back, my libido, my ability to enjoy music and laughter, my clear head. Not feeling tired even without sleep. Not falling asleep in the evening.

I could not recommend a good taper and jump enough. It is tough, but essentially just feeling ill. After a few days all is good and you feel alive.

I wanted to briefly share an opportunity for anyone who is interested: If you are 18 or older and in recovery from any substance use, we'd love if you considered joining our research initiative, the International Quit & Recovery Registry (IQRR).

The IQRR is a part of Virginia Tech and is IRB-approved. It's aimed at understanding recovery from addiction. Membership is free and anonymous, and members can complete compensated online surveys about their recovery experience. Each survey pays $5.00-$10.00 depending on the length of time and payments are made through PayPal. (There is no minimum commitment required to be or remain a member.) We also have additional resource lists, our published journal articles available to read, staff blog posts, and more.

A great deal of research has been done on understanding addiction and developing more effective treatments, but little has been directed towards people who are in recovery and understanding their experience. We believe that recovery is an inclusive process and we know it may not always be linear - we welcome you to register and participate regardless of whether or not you are currently using any substances. **We also welcome and are grateful to learn from anyone who uses medication-assisted treatment, including methadone and Suboxone.**

But if I wait until I've gotten up and begun moving around and my blood is pumping THEN take it I've noticed I feel the effects a lot better. I'm guessing after waking up your heart rate is lower so the medication isn't being distributed as quickly, whereas taking it after moving around makes sure the medication is getting spread throughout your body more properly. Or maybe after waking up your metabolism isn't as active but it speeds up when you're moving around so the body processes the medication more effectively.

Well, he decided he wanted to get some coke in between jobs right? The dealer was taking forever, and he told me ""i grabbed the wrong bag, im omw now"" so I already knew what the fuck was up. Anyways, we get it, we go on our way. He takes a bump, and says something about the taste, so i took a bump. I noticed that sweet, tasty drip. It was fentanyl. I told my boy this after i took the bump and he still decided to take a few more bumps. 30 minutes later hes slumped out in the back of the Uhaul. Had to call the ambulance and everything.

I got back on suboxone and began to taper. I use cannabis every day and even got my medical card, and take mushrooms maybe twice a year. I don't drink.

So ever since March 27, 2021 I haven't used a single pill, line, or shot, and I've gotten down to 0.5mg of suboxone, jumping soon. HUGE accomplishment, over a year clean!

Yes, I am that person. I had never been physically dependent on opiates even though I have had several stints of abusing heroin heavily. Just never for more than X amount of days without X amount of days off and so on. I have taken Suboxone and Subutex in the past. For recreation. What I really liked is how for days afterwards I would not really think about drugs(as opposed to obsessing over them). For days after taking buprenorphine I would be content simply by existing.  

I thought that if I could experience this indefinitely, it would be worth making myself physically dependent.

The new doctor that I got said that she cannot prescribe me any more either so I rly don’t know what to do, what would be the best option in a situation like this? 

I really want to get off of it but the withdrawals are just to fucking much, I always know I’m going into withdrawal when I get restless leg/arm syndrome, speaking of that what can I do or take to prevent RLS? 

Restless leg syndrome is the thing that gets me the worst when I’m in withdrawal. 

The worst part about this is I’m starting a new job tomorrow and pretty soon I am going to be feeling like shit, wtf do I do?!

Btw I have been tapering on my own since I got out of rehab, I haven’t had a doctor in so long so none of anything I did was recommended by a medical professional, they just sent me on my way with a 30 count box of 2mg suboxone films when I got out.

How bad will I be in withdrawal taking the jump from this dose and how long will I be in withdrawal?

While I was on Suboxone films, many people complained about how yellow my teeth were, and some days I felt like I didn't have enough dose. Then my insurance got changed.

Miraculously, my new insurance didn't cover films and only covered Zubsolv. I've never heard of this brand before, so I tried it. Zubsolv worked much better for me, and it's way cleaner for my teeth. 

**Since taking Zubsolv, everybody stopped talking about how yellow my teeth are. So not only does it taste better (menthol), it absorbs faster (5 mins) and has more steady bioavailability.**

Suboxone film bioavailability was more hit-and-miss, and I now realize this after taking Zubsolv. There were some days I felt like I didn't have enough dose while I was on Suboxone. I don't have this problem with Zubsolv anymore.

I usually take methadone, very high doses (240-280mg); ran out, so decided to take suboxone I had lying around, never took it before.

I thought I was in adequate WD to take it but I was very wrong, about 1h from the 8mg dose I got the most intense withdrawal I ever experienced, even cold turkey off 280mg methadone didn't do that.

It's been around 32h now, withdrawals are still present. Around T+2h after the first dose I read online that PWD is sometimes treated with more bupre so I took a total of 40mg then.

Also sprinkling a lot of benzos on the top to help with wd. The 40mg dose helped a bit and turned it from PWD into manageable WD.

It has been a long, pretty awful journey for both of us but I am very hopeful that we’re nearing the end of it… The worst of the symptoms were over after about 6-8 weeks, but after 7 months, he still has AWFUL insomnia.

About 2-3 years into being on subs, I was taking 3 Subutex a day. I was on probation, and I violated over having weed in my system. I had been on probation for 2 months maybe, and I quit smoking the day I started probation. So I was drug tested every week because of the THC, it was sent to a lab and they would say how much is in my system. So as long as it kept going down, I was good. Then one day at home I get a knock on the door from a regular looking dude. Yay for me, it was a cop serving a warrant, so I was arrested. I never smoked so I don’t know how it went up or if it even did. 

So I get to jail, and I’m not freaking out or anything, just figured I’d bond out and be good. Nope. No bond. No reason as to why. I wasn’t a flight risk. Anyways I spent 19 days in jail, and every day I was waiting for my withdrawal to hit. Day after day went by, nothing.

I've been on **16 mg** for a over a year. I started my taper, but had difficulties at 3mg. Went one step back up to **4 mg** and that's where I'm at now.

I have much less side effects now. I feel more clear-headed and less 'fake' with people; my social interactions feel more genuine. So I'm fairly happy with this dose.

I am unsure if I want get off this drug at all at this moment. I might stay on it for years or for life.

**Concerns:**

I'm concerned about inter-dose symptoms. I feel a slight boost in my mood that allows me to work better after each dose. This fades after about 5 hours. I believe it wears off quicker at the lower dosages. I dose twice a day now (2x2mg). I go the the gym at the same time every day, and take my second dose exactly before that, so I can use that boost for the work-out.

This does mean my life is fairly centered around the Suboxone dosing. The monthly injections are not available in my country. There are transdermal patches used for pain management. I'm considering asking my doctor for those, as to have a more stable level of buprenorphine in me - this would probably get rid of the ups and downs. But that's a different discussion!

I am concerned that this effect gets worse with lower dosage such as 3, 2 or 1 mg/day. Any comments on this are welcome as well.

About 5 days after starting I went to the doctor with a strange head pain. Not a headache, but every 5 minutes a sharp pain behind my left eye at the temple. I went to bed early and woke up and to my surprise it was still happening. 

I had taken zubsolv for about 6 months 4 years ago and didn’t notice any issues…

Another definite correlation I didn’t notice is about 30 minutes after dosing my neck gets uncomfortably tense…

I noticed it gaming during high intensity FPS like Halo or Fortnite or PUBG, and chalked it up to being tense from gaming…but after another week I noticed it even while lying down…

I did experience some very mild w/d symptoms during certain stages but they were totally manageable.


At 0.4 + 0.2mg my dose was only lasting effectively for around 18-20 hours so I was fully expecting to start experiencing proper withdrawals within a couple of days of jumping.


I'm pleasantly surprised that I've been totally fine, up to now. I've actually been feeling better than I was at the end stages of my taper, even though I was feeling pretty good then too.


I have been taking some OTC supplements which I saved for the jump so I'm assuming this explains the slight improvement.


I know a lot of people don't start to feel w/d's for several days but they're usually jumping from a higher dose than me.


If I was gonna experience acute w/d's surely they'd be knocking at my door by now?

fast forward to getting out of detox: I suffered in withdrawal for like another 2 days until I found a single crushed up 8mg subutex pill which I then started using to not feel so shitty. 
1st day I think I used around 3mg of it. 
2nd day I used around 2mg
3rd day around 1mg
4th day probably <1mg

I have a little bit of it left for tomorrow  but will try to avoid using it even if I feel bad since I will be able to just stay home in bed.

Should I expect to have withdrawal?

I just had a medical procedure and the 5mg Percocets I was prescribed just aren’t hacking it for the pain I’m in. I got off my Suboxone three week ago to do all I could to ensure the post-op pain control was manageable. They wouldn’t give me anything stronger than 5mg Percs and said if I needed stronger to defer to the Suboxone doctor who of course won’t write my narcotics.

I also plan on reducing the amount of Subs I am taking every 5 days by 25% until I am down to about .25mg and will then jump. If at any point I don’t adjust to a lower dose, I will increase by .25 and stay for another 4 days until I feel good. 

Any advise with any of the above? All opinions are appreciated.","['CDU', 'MA']",0,1,0,1,0,0

I am struggling to come off years of opiates for many many years and need some positives vibes and words of wisdom from those of you that have already detached from this horrible drug.

I had planned to reduce the amount of methadone I had been taking and did so over the course of March&April and haven’t used any now for 12 days, however, I still was buying fentadope about 3-4 times a week.

I tapered down to .25mg/day for two weeks before I jumped, and barely had withdrawals. Mentally I felt so much better only a week or so after the jump. Had some minor sleep disturbances and sweating/chills days 4-7, but that was it! I tried to jump off 2mg a few months before that and for me, that was a terrible idea. Went back on it after about 30 days and tapered much lower. Best decision I ever made. 

I started at 8mg a year and a half before and once I got down to 2mg, I made sure to finish the taper out long. At 2mg I started alternating days of 2mg then 1mg, then 2 days 1mg and 1 day 2mg, and so on. I stayed at .75, .5, and .25 each for two weeks.

I personally don't take opoids or suboxone and never have so I have zero experience with this. However I am facing a huge issue with my mom who is. 

my mom has been hooked on opoids for 10yrs+ and recently, 4 months ago, quit with the help of suboxone. 

She has cut her dose of sub down to a 1/4 pill per day (not sure the dose) and is losing her mind. 

She is convinced my entire family is out to get her and are putting cameras/recording devices in her attic. She claims to have videos of them but will never show me. She thinks everyone around her at work is a ""spy"" for the family etc. 

It is insane, I'm not sure how to deal with this. She seemingly trusts me, but just today I said ""hey maybe you should still be taking your full dose of suboxone"" and she lost her mind and said im one of them. 

Please, does anyone have tips or time lines on when she will stop being like this? Does weening off suboxone really make people crazy like this?!

Another note: she smokes a ton of weed, and is on 2 anti depressants as well as a strong blood thinner. I'm not entirely sure how those play a role as she only started acting like this since she started cutting the suboxone dose...

3887,uptdcr,"Suboxone and Cannabis. Hey guys,
With the legalization of cannabis for adult recreational use now a go for adults 21+ in 23 states, it begs a complicated question. There is a lot of evidence to support that smoking weed while on Suboxone doesn't have as many negative side effects as they say. A lot more clinics these days are ""THC friendly"" and won't fail you or kick you out for testing positive for THC so long as you come out negative for everything else. I know there is a lot of contraversy around mental health and whether someone getting clean off drugs should be smoking pot, but in my opinion you're still taking Suboxone, you're still taking a drug, and there is science that backs up positive interactions between cannabis and Suboxone, It helps reduce nausea, helps with the restlessness that can come with Suboxone, it helps as a sleep aid, pain reducer, anti anxiety, anti inflammatory, and that's just to start. Suboxone tends to make you feel like crap after you take it for a long time and honestly cannabis kind of helps with that crappy feeling, you can actually eat you don't feel sick to your stomach all the time. Everyone is different but I do believe there can be benefit to using cannabis while on opioids whether you're still using or trying to detox.

I was shooting about a gram a day of decent H for the last year. I tried a CT/Rapid sub taper detox and I was able to stay off opiates for about a month. However, I kept trying to lower my sub dose and I eventually spiraled into a relapse that lasted 3 months.

This is when the bernese method came into play. During my relapse I always made sure I took at least 1mg of sub so it never left my system. About 2 weeks ago I decided I would start to up my sub dose each day and see if I could get off the dope.

Each day I went up .5mg. This was easy until I got to 4mg. At 4mg I would start feeling mild WDs about 2 hours after taking it and would use dope to get out. I kept pushing and by the time I got to 8mg, I was out of dope.

Its been 60 hours since my last shot of heroin and I did not have any major PHYSICAL  withdraw symptoms. However I am an emotional wreck, motivation is low, and I just shot myself in the arm about 15 times with a pellet gun. I have about 6 lead pellets completely lodged in my arm that I have no way of getting out without surgical tools. The fucked up part of it all is that it actually made me feel better.

I explained that to the doctor but they didnt listen and said they're only starting me on 8mg because they don't think I need 16mg.

I then switched over to Tianeptine and reached 4g a day doses and when i stopped tia I started taking subs from the streets. I basically worked my way up to 16mg because i wanted to completely block my receptors so I dont have temptation if that makes sense.

3942,ulfxlh,"NEW anecdotal evidence of buprenorphine potentiation. So, I made a post on this sub about 2 months ago citing a study about potentiating buprenorphine ORALLY.
As most of us know, we take suboxone sublingually because it has poor bioavailability if swallowed. Well, after buying some ginger root extract along with milk thistle (source of silymarin), I decided to test the study on myself.
I’m incredibly happy to report that my subutex is now working for me how it use to years ago. What I mean by that is: it lasts all day without me thinking about it or feeling like I need to redose 8-10 hours later and half my dose is effective.
I had abused tianeptine prior to getting into OPT again recently for the 6th time in my life. I personally felt like the tia destroyed my opioid receptors (or perhaps increased my normal enzymes permanently) because no matter what the opioid nor the dose would affect me the way it used to years ago prior to tia abuse.

TL;DR
I took ginger root extract along with silymarin to inhibit CYP enzymes so that I can take buprenorphine orally and have the bioavailability better than sublingual or intranasal.

EDIT: after a few days of trial and error, IME, just taking 250mg of ginger root extract orally with my buprenorphine (oral/ swallowed as well) once a day has been incredibly sufficient.

My history: 
I have a couple painful conditions and I was prescribed hydromorphone 10mg a day. I was told by my doc I should start tapering so I panicked and met someone offline who started selling me hydromorphone 8mg. Fast forward- I started taking 200mg plus hydromorphone a day. I was scheduled to have surgery and it kept getting cancelled but I finally ended up having it. 

Now that I’ve had my surgery, I’ve managed to ween myself off to 24mg of hydromorphone every 4 hours. I still experience mild withdrawal symptoms just before my next dose is due. 

I’m at the end of my rope. I’m sick of constantly being in withdrawal. I’m afraid taking subs will be huge time commitment. I don’t intend staying on something for years. I don’t have urges to take hydromorphone. I only take it to get rid of withdrawals. 

Has anyone else been on a high dose of hydromorph and easily transitioned to subs ? How was the transition? What dose did you stabilize on? What would you do if you were in my shoes ?

I plan to take 2mg in afternoon and 2mg tonight. Will this be okay ? Will I be okay or am I just too early on to notice ? I know BUP has a long half life. Anyone with experience please let me know.

3966,uikoe8,what would you do ?. I've been on IV fent on and off for years and recently had two years clean and then relapsed hard and went on a several months long bender. I found myself in the hospital a week ago for a medical problem and I was also trying to get off fent so I went to the ER in super bad withdrawal.

What I'm wondering is shes given me the option of helping me transfer from the Dilaudid to subs or helping me taper off the Dilaudid and be on nothing and I'm really torn about what to do. I don't want to go back into withdrawal. It's excruciating coupled with the medical problem I'm having.

For a couple hours after each dose I'd be ok, but then long before my next dose I'd be going into pretty bad withdrawal feelings.

I thought ""ok, this is rough but I just need to push through and I'll even out soon,"" so I stuck it out.  For over a month.  A month and a week actually.  I *never stabilized.*  After a month I still felt just as bad as I did during the first week after the drop.  The thought of cutting even more was just too much.  Everyone here (mostly anyway) say to wait and stabilize at a dose before making a cut again.  But what if you never stabilize??  I finally gave up and went back up to 1.75mg twice per day.

4027,ueleip,"Looking to get on Sub or Methadone Program - Australia. Hey guys,

To cut a very long story short, after 15yrs+ of a daily opiate dependence, I’ve decided to finally try and get on a Bupe/suboxone or Methadone program.

I’m originally from the UK and it’s incredibly easy to get hold of most opiates on the internet and at GPs legitimately there. I’ve been a completely functioning opiate user most of my life and I’ve worked some hard jobs whilst still managing to compartmentalise my opiate dependence. Over the last 3-4 years, I’ve actually had Dihydrocodiene prescribed for a minor back problem which has helped massively for my mental health along with tramadol. For reference, was on about 8 x 30mg Dihydrocodiene a day then went onto 500mg of tramadol a day.

I came to Australia about a year ago with the hope to successfully continue my habit. Unfortunately, I’ve found out the hard way how difficult & expensive it is to get any opiates. I’m managing to get by on Poppy seed tea with weekly otc Rikodiene syrup purchases but it’s just not doing anything for me. I’m currently spending $100s a week on fuelling my habit and I just can’t deal with the stress & anxiety of financing and actually getting any opiates.

I’ve got a few questions with regards to anyone who’s on either program here if that’s ok? What are peoples experiences with Subs and the whole process? Can you pick what treatment is best for you? How much does it cost? 

Another predicament is that I’m on a provisional PR Visa and I’m worrieD my addiction treatment will affect my visa process 🤦🏻‍♂️

I’ve been dealing with all of this for awhile now and additional problems (especially gastrointestinal) from my bupe products not dissolving/absorbing properly. If this sounds like you, the problem is that your mouth is too acidic!!! I wish I could credit the person who mentioned how bupe needs an alkaline environment to dissolve properly. I read it awhile back and that started my adventure to fix my issue. Anyways, I recently began eating better, less acidic food and drinking more and more water. With this came better absorption and feeling a lot better in general. The final straw was being diagnosed with GERD and being prescribed a PPI. 

I started this now 3 days ago and day 2 I noticed a life changing difference in how my medication dissolved and how I felt. All around I felt like a new person. Tums were also recommended before dosing (prior to using my ppi) to reduce the acidity in the mouth before doing in order to counter the acidic bupe products. Please don’t go out taking a bunch of drugs without talking to your doctor. Don’t go crazy on tums and please try to eat and hydrate better.

Will there be a noticeable difference between starting the switch at 60 or so, rather than 50? Also, is it reasonable to think that I will be on my feet after the week long switch?

""Back to my old self"" for me would be craving opioids, like I've done since I first tried them at age 14. I did have 7 years abstinent with no cravings, which is amazing. But I lost that state, gradually, relapsed on hydrocodone and soon had a raging obsession with acquiring and using more narcotics.

I don't crave on Suboxone, so far anyway. I don't want to get back to ""normal"" since normal for me was a constant state of wanting to change the way I felt with drugs. At various times I've relied on hydrocodone, oxy, methadone, speed, weed, alcohol, muscle relaxers, benzos and kratom. That last was a truly ghastly drug for me. I'd rather be on Suboxone.

 Long story short, bupe user for ~6 years. Had a surgery Monday. I cut myself off the subs the previous Friday. I got heavily dosed with everything from Fent, Dilaudid, Oxy as well as oral OP oxys. Even after near 70 hours of no bupe, it took massive amounts of those narcs to break thru while in the OR. Was hell for a few minutes when it happened. But fine after that. Discharged with a little script of Roxys..just finished them. Not a bunch. 5mg x 21 in 4 days. Legs still feel like they could use another couple hundred mg of OC. 
 Anyways. Plan is to resume my bupe tomorrow.  Just don't want to do it too soon. Last couple days on a pitiful dose of 20mg Roxy, I'd last maybe 6 to 8 hours before I started feeling like shit. Sorry for the novel. Advice?","['CDU', 'MA']",0,1,0,1,0,0

We've had discourse here on how addicts are not treated the same as non addicts when it comes to adequate treatment of pain. I felt like I signed up to be a test dummy after my spinal fusion L5S1.  I must have taken 7 different pain targeting drugs,,,, none opiods. I must have went thru 3 different types of rehabilitation. Then came the psychotropics. Who the hell prescribes psyche drugs for physical pain ?  Scared unqualified doctors who care more about what the CDC says about their patients than the actual patients themselves. Thats who.
Then came the L4 cirrhosis diagnosis. I though for sure a terminal illness would bring some pain relief. Wrong again. 
   When I see the high rates of deaths associated with the opiod crisis I always wonder how many were people in real pain seeking relief. Were they so desperate that they took a chance with that little blue pill that looks exactly like the real ones ?  Was the pain so bad they were willing to risk death ? 
  How much death was caused by doctors abandoning their patient's needs due to the 2016 CDC guidelines ?  Many of us here have long said the CDC actually fueled the fears in doctors and only made the opiod crisis worse. Not better.

Now we are seeing the harms  those 2016 guidelines  have been causing come to light.  Its a shame when we patients say it causes harm and are not believed. I guess  it only matters when a doctor says so.",['OTH'],0,0,0,0,0,1

I take about 6-8mg a day, and it does help me pretty well for my pain. I do like that it’s a steady amount of pain relief rather than the ups and downs of oxy, but I have a whole bunch of side effects that make me hesitant to continue it.  I don’t have any side effects with oxy (other than pain relief and feeling much more energized and less brain foggy and tired like the suboxone). 

I guess my question is this. If I took my Suboxone tonight, and choose to go back to my regular 10mg dose of oxycodone in the morning (and the rest of the day) will I get any or much pain relief, since the suboxone will probably still be bound to the receptors for a few days? I’m aware that the suboxone is technically stronger…right? Lol

What would be the best way to transition without risk of precipitated WD.  Ween down to 2mg, then abruptly stop taking for how long before being able to safely transition.   From experience,  the Kratom type I'd recommend (I'm no kratom expert) would be Red Mang Dae.  I've personally used it from opiate WD and they stopped completely and I was normal.   Also, an ex weened down gradually off high dose of Methadone, then at 35mg she stopped completely.   3 1/2-4 days later she was suffering bad.  I bought either 7lbs or 7 Kilos of Kratom & the Red Mang Dae & a Red Dragon alleviated all symptoms completely.   Now subs are different bc of the  Naloxone, so would it be best to ween  to 2mg then wait a certain amount of days, then take Kratom,  or would it be best for him to just stop taking his  8mg abruptly & when he starts getting sick then take the Kratom.  If their is a method to this like their is switching from Methadone to subs using COWS checklist to address level of WD n prevent  precipitated WD I'm all ears.  Thanks!",['CDU'],0,0,0,1,0,0

How long since last smoking fent do i need to wait before beginning microdosing?

How do i figure out the dosages of the suboxone strip though?

Yesterday my new sub Dr. insisted that going from Kratom directly to subs would throw me into PW and argued with me when I told him it wouldn't. 

My last dose of Kratom was about 3 p.m, I took 8 mg. Of sub by 4-5 p.m and as usual didn't get the slightest bit sick. 

I've switched from Kratom directly to subs hundreds of times and this has never happened, even when going from 100 or so grams a day directly back to subs without skipping a dose of Kratom. 

Am I the only one? Has switching ever thrown any of you into PW? 

Can anyone explain why it would or wouldn't?

I know the alkaloids in Kratom stimulate opioid receptors, is it possible they just don't ""stick"" like say oxy or h, therefore don't get removed when the bupe comes in?

I also wonder why I felt fatigue almost 2 months after my last sub dose even while using Kratom, then got all my energy back an hour after restarting subs. It's odd to me bc Kratom has alkaloids that give you energy but subs are only supposed to effect the opioid receptors right?

4203,u11kfp,"Clomid for low testosterone. Has anyone used this medication to address their low-T as a result of their long term buprenorphine maintenance?

My T levels came back low, and my GP offered me topical testosterone replacement to get my levels back up. However, I haven't filled the script because of the long term effects of T replacement therapy, namely infertility (of which for some men isn't reversible once they cease their hormone replacement). Also the idea of having nuts the size of raisins doesn't really appeal to me.

So the only other options to address the condition are Clomid, or HCG. The idea is taking Clomid is more appealing, mainly because it addresses the issue at the source (the pituitary), which is where opioids exert their endocrine side effects.

Has anyone here used Clomid or HCG?  What was your experience?  Did you need an endocrinologist or urologist to prescribe?  Or could you get it off your primary physician?

I'm aware some people will come in and say ""why not reduce or go off Suboxone"". Unfortunately, my opioid problem is such that I need higher doses to prevent relapse. Presently I'm on 300mg a month of Sublocade, which is similar to 16mg+ of Suboxone. Any less than this and I end up with a needle in my arm. I've come off Sub a couple of times and had about 2 years clean in NA both times, but I still relapsed despite doing all the suggested things. It's for this reason I plan to stay on Sublocade this time.

Used to be stable on 4mg suboxone for frame of reference. But after a bad relapse I went on methadone up to 90mg. I have now made the decision to move back to suboxone, and have tapered down to 35mg methadone.

My plan is to take 72hrs since my last dose, or until withdrawal symptoms are mild. At that point I'm just curious what dose would you guys think would be needed to stabilize? I'm sure it's subjective, and varies from person to person, but I'm just looking for a ballpark for what dose I should expect to need so I'm not so in the dark. Seems no where on Google can really tell me. I read somewhere that 30mg methadone equals around 8mg suboxone.

I currently have only 8 mg subutex pills, so accurately measuring doses much smaller than where I currently am without volumetric dosing is going to be difficult.  From what I have seen, most people recommend dissolving at a concentration of 1 mg/ml (so I would apparently use 8 ml of water to dissolve 1 pill).  My question is when dosing the liquid, do I have to worry about losing the liquid by accidentally swallowing it, or will the volume be small enough that it will be easy for it to quickly be absorbed under my tongue?  I haven't tried volumetric dosing yet, but I am wondering what would happen if I were to squirt .7 ml of the solution (so .7 mg buprenorphine) under my tongue.

On the flight over I checked and realized I grabbed the wrong bottle, which only has 10 mg total in it. I'm working halftime while over here too (remote work from computer). It's 1 day in at a ""rationed 2 mg dose"", and I feel the darkness coming. I've checked to see if I can get a prescription filled here and it's looking unlikely unless I go the ER. So my options:
1. Ration it evenly. I could take between 1.5-2 mg for 6 days, then the 7th day I would be back home.
2. Front load it. Take it normally for the first few days, then go 3 days with zero until I get home.
3. Back load it. Skip 2-3 days now then resume near-normal dosing.

I've withdrawn before. I do not care about the physical  symptoms. I can shit my pants all day and be alternating sweating/freezing and this doesn't bother me. It's the depression, anxiety and insomnia that are unbearable for me. 

I also have a Valium prescription, which I am also tapering. I called my doctor in Canada about my situation and his advice was to double the Valium for just this week until I get back to take the edge off.

Trying to get below 2 becomes exceedingly difficult for most people for some reason, but it can be done. I believe  for some people, microdosing sub once you’ve been on maintenance for a while is the best option—you get a buzz while getting to keep hold of your sense of self, you feel much less “on” something.

someone shared this with me over reddit, and I didn’t really believe them, but I noticed while the ends of the day were certainly a little more shitty (bad mood, fatigue) they were not bad at all or anything I would consider to be withdrawl. 

After reading that I thought I would give a shot at skipping days, as I supposedly already had I guess relatively small amounts of bupe in my system 

next thing I knew I accidentally went 4 days without any sub! 

took a tiny .15 mg dose, as i’m not in a hurry and wanted to land this plane smoothly as possible. after that last dose I noticed an upswing in my mood as soon as day 4. it’s gotten better every week since!

So fellas! land this plane! you wouldn’t crash it into the ground right? you wouldn’t speed up as you got closer to the runway, right? the closer you get to the finish line , the lighter you pull up on the “plane” and your efforts. 

same concept! your mental health is important to get through this successful. be nice to yourself. that’s the biggest issue I had.","['MA', 'TP']",0,1,0,0,1,0

4368,uu3pyt,"Six Months and I'm Close to the Edge and Ready to Jump. Hi folks,

At the tail end of last year, I politely asked my Doctor how long I had been prescribed my daily dose of 16mg of Subutex. Before even asking the question, I had it in my head that I had only been on the medication for two years at the VERY most. When he took a pause before informing me that I had been on Subutex for 4 and a half years, I nearly fell out of my chair! Honestly.. I couldn't believe it... Hearing that though, was the words that I REALLY needed to really get my shit together and begin tapering.

Since December, I've managed to reduce my daily dosage down from 16mg down to where I stand today at 0.1mg. This subreddit has been an absolute blessing. Without it, I'd have had zero clue on how best to taper, comfort meds, volumetric dosaging etc.

The question I have right now is regarding that final dosage before jumping all together. At what dose do you recommend that I jump? There seems to be an awful lot of people that jump at around 100mg. That being said, since I have the luxury of being able to jump at doses as low as 5mg thanks to volumetric dosing, at what dose would you recommended? My original plan was to jump at 50mg.

Thankfully I've stocked up on Clonidine, Gabapentin, Magnesium, etc so I'm ready to rock n' roll. The question is, whether or not, tapering to an even lower dose than 50mg would make things that little bit more comfortable?",['TP'],0,0,0,0,1,0

If I use subs for a total of 1 week, and then stop, will this really just be WD day 1? Will I feel sick again?

So I stopped drinking Poppy tea on Sunday AM it's now Wednesday AM and since Monday night I started eating tiny bits of Sub like 1 mg at a time.

4392,us16ki,"Suboxone making me sick? What to do next?. I have been taking Suboxone for almost three weeks. Started at 4-8mg a day and recently increased to 12mg to see if it helps with anxiety and it didn’t. I feel horrible now. Back down to 4-8mg per day for three days, but I think the anxiety is way worse now since I now have anxiety about the possibility of suboxone making me sick. 

I often have negative side effects from any medication. At first, I noticed a little bit of nausea and headaches, but now I consistently feel nauseous, anxious, and just overall sick. It doesn’t help that I also came down with the flu or a bad cold (negative covid). At first, I thought it was all just from the flu, but now am convinced it is also the suboxone. Also now have problems at work, and at home, and most are my own doing/my own thinking. Really think it is all related to the suboxone. I don’t seem to do well with it. I still kind of feel like crap from the flu, but didn’t take my suboxone dose, waited, and then took a little bit of oxy (snorted like \~4mg) and I felt better almost immediately. More like myself again. 

Now super high anxiety because I don’t know what to do next. Do I try and taper the suboxone? Do I take enough oxy for a week to get past the suboxone wd’s and then taper the oxy? What about methadone? I didn’t want to be chained to a clinic, but is it less likely to have all these side-effects from methadone? If so, maybe it is a better option for me.

So I just moved to a new state and filled my script and got Dr. Reddys (previous was Mylan for a long-time). Maybe I got a bad batch but holy shit these were terrible. Been on these Reddys for about 2 months and feeling crummy. I have an autoimmune disease and some other things going on so I didn’t suspect the Dr Reddys strips at first.

It finally dawned on me that maybe the strips were the problem, so I got a prescription for the brand name. Wow, what a difference!! On the brand name strips, I feel more clear-headed, less jaw clench, and the dose lasts much longer. My autoimmune flare up also stopped--it turns out that being in slight wd from the weak Dr Reddys strips caused my condition to flare up which can actually turn into a life threatening event as my breathing is affected!

1. When you put your strip under your tongue do you lift your tongue to the roof of your mouth to where the strips kinda stay in the air where they don’t touch the bottom of your mouth or do you put them under your tongue then press your tongue to the bottom of your mouth so there basically sandwiched between the bottom of your tongue and the bottom of your mouth?

2. Do you put your strips somewhere else besides under your tongue if so where?

I used to snort oxys, smoke and bang H, smoke and snort fent... All of it. I always had IBS with diarrhea, the drugs just made me normal. It was great. No painful flare ups, no agonizing shits multiple times a day... Then came getting clean, and bupe.

I often go around a week without a BM. It starts to suck hard after day 3 or so. Cranky, lethargic, bloated, the whole nine. Serious constipation makes you feel terrible 😥
No meds worked right. All variations and types of laxatives, nada.

My new plan, now that I've figured it out, is just hold off on my first dose of the day no matter what, until I can go.. Because god damn y'all, I easily just let go of multiple pounds of waste, not to mention blocked up gas. My stomach is flat again. I feel human!!!

i couldn't pay for my prescriptions anymore. i was using a telemedicine situation. so i used what i had from them and tried to taper. although that didn't work cause im an addict and i said ""im going to run out anyways, might as well take them like normal""

Happy Friday!

I am in a little bind here…

Long story short, I have been on Subutex for five years and currently taking 8mg’s of Subutex and at a stable dose.

I have called probably over 40 clinics,doctors, pain management centers, you name it and I am having no luck.

I will still have Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois since I will be working from home, just in a different state and the only place that I called that was the closest to helping me out was Magnolia Medical, however they do not take BCBS of Illinois and they can’t even guarantee intake.

Also I have been in Suboxone but I have an allergic reaction on my face, my hands go numb, and I get dizzy when I stand up to where my vision gets blurry. 

That is why I have been on Subutex for the last 5 years and not Suboxone.

My fear is that I will move out there and not have a doctor lined up. It will make me extremely anxious.

I have never dropped dirty in my five years, never missed a doctors appointment, have not had a drink of alcohol since July 11th 2020, so that is my jam that I am currently in.

Last time I jumped from .5 I  relapsed on opiates. I believe I wasn’t in the right mental space at the time and had a “friend” who lived down the street who always had 30s, so it was a HUGE temptation. Of course I OD’d so I went back on Suboxone. Now that I’ve cut off that person months ago and no way of contacting them I truly believe that i’m mentally in a much stronger place than I was at the time I really want to get off this medication. I have no desire to take opiates. August 27th will mark 2 years since I started and I think it’s time to move on from this chapter. Plus spending $200+ a month is really killing me financially (no health insurance) I’d really appreciate some recommendations to make this a little easier on me, maybe some over the counter comfort meds, what helped you guys get through withdrawal, and what dose I should jump from to get the minimal amount of withdrawal, I was thinking .25.

4481,tfbhm4,"Naloxone Absorbed Via Mouth Wound?. Hey,

This might sound borderline insane, but does anybody have any experience with or even an educated guess as to whether or not Naloxone can be absorbed into the bloodstream via a cut or wound in the mouth?

Had a dental extraction done a couple weeks ago. Within a few days, I start feeling some typical withdraw like symptoms - runny nose, watery eyes, ANXIETY, and strangest of all - diarrhea. I saw strange, because for the past 3 years, I haven’t had a loose stool. Not even close. I’ve had to battle constipation. So imagine my surprise when out it comes - as the joke goes, there was a race out of my bum and everyone was winning.

Taken individually, I wouldn’t think about Subs, but all together? The extraction site obviously is still forming new tissue and provides access to the bloodstream, to a degree, and the gums were pretty beat up in the process, and I’m thinking - is it possible that every time I take subs, I’m absorbing some Naloxone which is bumping some off the receptors, not causing full blown withdrawal, but almost like a mini taper of sorts. 

I can’t explain my symptoms otherwise, had it checked and there wasn’t an infection (my first thought), so now I’m at a loss; and the anxiety seems to be worsening, and the tummy troubles continuous for 3-4 days now.

Today they put me on subs, 2mg. They also prescribed me 100mg morphine slow release for the first 6 days to take with my sub.

My mom is on subutex and I’m on suboxone. 
She was recently on Suboxone but they switched her over to subutex because she has cirrhosis of the liver.
Long story short, she thinks subutex is COMPLETELY different than suboxone. My whole point to her is it’s buprenorphine which is the SAME Ingredient in both suboxone and subutex, only thing is suboxone has naloxone and subutex doesn’t have that. She thinks naloxone is the only only opiate blocker and buprenorphine doesn’t block opiates. 

She also thinks coming off subutex will
Be easier than coming off of suboxone because of it not “blocking opiates” and that if she needed pain medicine she’d feel it 100% because she takes Subutex 😂 

My whole point to her is that they are basically the same just the naloxone will make you go into precipitated withdrawals if you abuse it by snorting or IV usage etc. I could be completely wrong and have no clue about any of this. She thinks buprenorphine won’t block other opiates from working like suboxone does? Would love a break down for her to read or understand, or for me to understand if I’m wrong about it.

4572,t5dh10,"Bernese method for micro induction of buprenorphine/suboxone/subutex.. For starters I’d like to say I transitioned from methadone to buprenorphine and had no noticeable withdrawals. I was scared for months prior to changing these meds, primarily because I have put myself into precipitated withdrawals from using too much buprenorphine while on methadone, and it was not fun. 
But it is possible to start buprenorphine without having to wait for your current opioid to leave your system. 
I will outline how I went about changing from methadone to buprenorphine now.
I was on approximately 40-50mg methadone per day, for about a decade, I’d been on much higher doses also, and I do not believe dose amount matters for the Bernese method. 
The first day, I took my methadone dose as normal, and took approximately .25mg subutex. A quarter of a milligram is not enough to precipitate withdrawals, so if you start with small doses, you’ll be fine. Day 2, kept taking my methadone,(40mg) and took approximately .5mg buprenorphine and felt fine. Day 3, decreased methadone to 30 mg and took .75mg buprenorphine, felt fine.
Day 4 took 25 mg methadone and 1 mg buprenorphine and still felt fine.
Day 5 took 20 mg methadone and 1.5mg buprenorphine and felt fine.
Day 6 took 15 mg methadone and took 2mg suboxone.
Day 7 took 10 mg methadone and 3 mg buprenorphine.
Day 8 took zero methadone and took 4mg buprenorphine.
After the 8th day, the methadone had zero effects, I tried taking a 20mg dose and felt nothing.

Everyday I see someone say they’ve been on subs for a month or two without any relapses and they want to get off subs already. Apparently they think they magically cured years of opiate addiction with 2 months sober with the help of subs lol. A suboxone program should be for AT LEAST a year without any relapses. 

Sure, suboxone may help you get through withdrawals by doing a sub taper for a couple weeks to get off heroin fent or pain pills. However, withdrawal is the easy part of opiate addiction. The hard part is staying clean for the rest of ur life and not relapsing and ODing.  

Relapse rate of opiate addicts is above 85% within 6 months of getting off opioids with no maintenance program. Any health organization or doctor will tell you that MAT or MMT is the best treatment available for opioid addiction right now. 

So what I’m saying is, if you think you’re ready to get off suboxone after a month or two and think you can stay sober, you’re most likely not. There’s an 85% chance you’ll relapse within 6 months. Hopefully this rant will convince someone!",['OTH'],0,0,0,0,0,1

I screwed up with ODSMT. It was my anti-depressant. I was on it for like 5 months and reached a daily dose of more than 1200mgs. Then, sunday early in the morning, I took my last dose. 

I'm in this process with a rehab clinic. My personal rehab doctor put me on Suboxone. I waited until I scored 26 on the COWS scale (it was on monday, late afternoon). Then I took 2 by 2mgs like they said I should. 

I stabilised yesterday on 16mg but still feel lethargic, depressive, anxious and uncomfortable.

Is this normal?

The doctor told me that I would stabilise for a week on 16mgs (taken as 2x 8mgs sublingually at 10 AM in the morning), and then slowly in two weeks taper off it.

Is this even possible? Why am I taking such a high dose of Suboxone and still feel sick as fk? 

Can anybody give me some advices?",['MA'],0,1,0,0,0,0

I cushioned the blow with kratom, weed, comfort meds, and today is my first day with no kratom, no opiates at all!!!

I’m really proud of myself. I’m also terrified. I’ve gone back so many times, “just one last time” gets me into trouble. I have easy access to both subs and pills which I’ve tried to distance myself from as much as possible. How do I get rid of the “reservations” thoughts?

4601,su0xre,"8 1/2 months Suboxone free.. Just a little testimonial for y’all! 10 years ago a doctor put me on 24mg of subs to come off of Oxy’s. Literally do not ask why so high of a dose because I could not tell you. I was naive and looking for help and didn’t know any better. Anyway, I didn’t want to be on this shit forever and decided I wanted off of it. However the doctor was like you will need to taper and that’ll take a year. I basically was like no way in hell am I going to be on this shit another year. I want to be perfectly clear that for TEN YEARS, I was on 24mg daily and NEVER missed a dose. Period. I’m a 35 year old female as well with two children so I’m no spring chicken! So, On 5/27/21 I flew to a detox facility and they did a rapid taper and I took my very last Suboxone ever in my life on 6/4/21. It was the most agonizing lengthy withdraw I’ve ever experienced. Different from opiates. It wasn’t intense like opiates it was painful but loooooong. It took me 6-7 months to start to feel better, but I did it. I could not have done it without God being at the center of my life and a support system that carried me. 

Withdraws for lesser doses typically don’t last as long as mine did. You have to remember me coming off 24mg was a CHOICE, I made with knowledge of the consequence of longer withdraw. 

I’m here to tell you that if I can do it you can to! One thing I always recommend is never comparing yourself to others. I would read peoples experiences and it would defeat me.

4619,srljtj,"Dose wearing off too soon?. So I got prescribed Suboxone strips 8mg once a day 4 days ago due to heroin/fentanyl and tianeptine addiction. I have been prescribed the strips before about maybe 5-6 years ago but they were the name brand strips. These strips are the yellow package Alvogen strips. I’ve been dosing once a day at 8am but I feel that my dose wears off towards the end of the day, even around like 6pm. I mean my pupils even go back to normal and even get rather large around that time.

My question is should I split my dose up? 4mg at 8pm and another 4 around 5-6pm? I do not plan on tapering any time soon. It’s just weird for me because I don’t remember suns wearing off that quick. I also got prescribed subs last year for a couple years through bupe.me, although no pharmacy would fill them so I had to use their mail order pharmacy and the subs came in the form of a “troche” which is a small waxy block that dissolves the same as strips do. Those were apparently buprenorphine-naloxone 8-.2mg. So substantially less naloxone but they did not feel very much like regular sub so it was kinda weird but they did last longer.

The fact that the lowest dose is 2 mg strips is almost proof the pharmaceutical companies have zero compassion for people that want to get off opiates.

Previously I had split up a bunch of medicine into .125, .25, .5, .75, 1, 1.25 and 2mg doses. This has paid off in spades throughout the past two weeks.

Tegretol is common knowledge it seems among prescribing doctors who stay on top of medication interactions. It's a well known CYP3a4 inducer, meaning it speeds up the enzyme that breaks down Buprenorphine such that higher doses are required to get the same effect.

However, owing to my genetics, I also seem to have the same problem with Depakote, which is frustrating for me because it's actually a really effective mood stabiliser in my case with minimal side effects. Strangely Depakote isn't supposed to have the same problem, but I swear for me it does. If I'm on Depakote, I need to consistently take 300mg Sublocade injections or I start craving again. And if I can't take higher doses of Subuxone/Sublocade, no or minimal blockade is provided.

P.S. Does anyone do the buccal administration? It's received a lot of high praise; I tried it a few days ago and wasn't really impressed. Only upside is you can actually talk without a mouthful of saliva. That's a pretty big advantage to me but if it's less effective no thanks.

4875,rv2e83,"IV suboxone Half-Life speed?. Here is a preemptive apology because I have googled this question, IV suboxone Half-Life speed reddit, about 100 times. The issue is there is no clear answer. Some say it's based on the bioavailability, which sublingual is 30% and IV is somewhere between 90% and 100%. So if that is true, the Half-Life will decrease immensely. 

Now, some more information: I just had brain surgery, a crainioctomy, and in the hospital was given 25ug of fentanyl every hour for a week an a half - then moved down to 8mg of hydomorphone and 20mg of oxycodone every 2 hours, then 4 for about 4 days and on my last two days was given firocet(sp? I know there is another I in there lol) and a rx to go home with. 
 So I have been having some breakthrough pain as well as pain from the 8 titanium screws they drove in. As my wife is on suboxone I used a quarter strip(2mg) IV maybe 3 or four times since 12/29 to 12/31. My test for my med manager is 1/6. So that gives me 1/1 -1/6 9am. I am wondering if using water, I drink 20oz x2 hr, will speed up anything if infact IV use of Suboxone does not lower the halflife time? I know someone will have done the research. I just need to be clean by 1/6 - if its too close ill probably reschedule. I've used the Half-Life calculators online, but dont know the new Half-Life if IV administration speeds it up based on bioavailability. 

Any help will be greatly appreciated. And smarter move here would be to take the pain situation to my doctor but if I pee dirty, it'll be worthless I believe. Please and thank you. Happy New Year and God bless.","['CDU', 'MA']",0,1,0,1,0,0

I took a full strip today because my cravings have been worse the past few days. I haven’t eaten today and have had nicotine pouches in all day, which is why I threw up I’m sure. I threw up about 15 minutes ago, not fun but whatever, I should have eaten something. My question is, after 4-5.5 hours after taking them, did they have enough time to pass the blood brain barrier and remain effective even though I threw up? I just don’t want to start feeling poorly if they didn’t absorb into my bloodstream. Pretty sure it will be fine and they had enough time but just figured I’d ask.

I put myself in a dilemma here and I desperately need advice. I have had three surgeries since 5/6/2021 and I have been on Suboxone for now 5 years and currently stable on 8 mg’s.

With the surgeries, I have had to go from 4mg’s pre-op to 16mg’s post surgery. And this cycle has happened 3 times and is making havoc on my emotional and physical state.

Long story short, with my last surgery, I was not able to taper at the pace my sub doctor required because my main goal was to get off this junk, but after three unsuccessful surgeries, my plan has taken a detour. 

Being on suboxone for 5 years, jumping up to 16mg’s after surgery doesn’t do a thing for pain, so this month around, I was scheduled to taper down to 6mg’s after being on 12 mg’s last month. 

Well I messed up. My next appointment is on 01/10 and I only have 32mg’s left. I kept on telling myself I would taper but I would experience stomach cramps and lack of sleep which kept me from tapering. 

Now I am in trouble…


Being accustomed to 8mg’s a day currently, my strategy is to take 4mg’s every other day until my appointment on 1/10 (16 days away with 32mg of sub left)

Is this a good strategy? Or will I be living in hell?

I quit them 9 weeks ago cold turkey and my life has been a living hell ever since. 

Some symptoms have improved, but over all I'm going through about what I did after week 1. At times I feel somewhat normal, but these periods end and I end up right back where I started. People here on this sub have described these episodes as the ""ups and downs of withdrawal"".

The thing I'm most concerned about is my extremely high blood pressure. I'm a very healthy young male, 25 and athletic. I eat well, hydrate well, sleep well. But still ever since I quit subs my blood pressure is almost always at or above 135 / 90. 

I also seem to lose feeling to my limbs very easily now. I get dizzy if I stretch even just a little and have to stand up so slowly that I feel like an elderly man.

But, I have to do this. I don't want my past to follow me around any longer.

So, how hard is it going to be? I need to prep myself. Is it going to keep getting harder with every cut down? Is it going to be awful for WEEKS after the very last one?

I can't seem to get past here. if I don't take it, I feel like shit, but it's quite possible that its my overactive brain, symbolic of my benzo use. I'll start yawning, getting really irritable, lethargic. Sometimes, even sniffles. It's just so hard to tell how much of ANY withdrawal is more mental or physical.

I've been on Suboxone for about four months now and haven't had any dental issues yet, but reading and hearing about other people having their teeth erode and disintegrate has made me a little skeptical...

Please comment whether you've HAD ISSUES OR NOT so that the data isn't skewed because I'm really trying to weigh my options here and make the decisions that'll lead to the best outcome. And more specifically I'm just trying to keep my teeth!

1. How would you rate your dental health before starting Suboxone? (Excellent, great, good/average, poor, very poor)
 
2. What is your dental hygiene like? (Frequency of brushing, flossing, mouthwash, etc.)

3. What are your eating/drinking habits like? 

4. How long have you taken Suboxone for?
 
5. Have you noticed any new dental issues since you've started Suboxone?

6. Strips or pills? How many milligrams are you on, how many times a day do you take them? 

7. What is your method of taking them? (For instance, mine is wake up, brush teeth, drink a few sips of water, put sub strip under tongue and swallow the spit as it forms then drink more water + swish some around. Also I don't eat, drink or smoke 30 mins before or after.

If you guys could fill this out thoroughly and accurately I would very much appreciate it and also the information would be helpful to others who are considering getting on subs.

Well, I originally had a date set of December 31st to be off the meds. But, wanted to taper as low as I possibly could which since Jan 1st was 1mg every other day, so just under 4mg per week. I still had a box of Suboxone films leftover yesterday morning, but those were given to a family member who took them with him up north to his property for the next 14 days. So, even if I wanted any access to them I am not driving almost 5hrs to the northern tip of Wisconsin where he's at. I'm very grateful he is helping me out on my journey. My last 1mg dose was late Tuesday night around the 10pm news, I have read that 1mg even every other day can still be a significant dose, but it beats jumping off of a way higher dose per day. I know what likely lies ahead and the only two meds I have on my end is Advil for any headaches or body pains and some weak 10mg Hydroxyzine for sleeplessness and slight anxiety. I know hydroxyzine doesn't do nothing for those with anxiety, but it works perfect for mine while putting me to sleep at the same time. Well, I won't keep any of you guys any longer, I just wanted to post the start of hopefully my now fully clean and sober chapter of my life, but I already know it won't be a walk in the park. Then again and in closing nothing worth doing should be easy. Have a wonderful Thursday to each and every one of you. Nothing, but love and support to those in and out of recovery.

So I’ve been tapering off subs for like almost 5 months after being on them for about a year after being on them on and off for a year before that when I was also on dope. I’ve been able to settle as low as .25mg/day. I get the 8mg strips and when I get occasional cravings I’ll up my dose too some extent maybe once every 2 weeks. 

So pretty much successfully got down to an even daily dose of .25mg sublingually. This past Thursday night I was getting some cravings and couldn’t sleep so I boofed a full 8mg. Now it’s Tuesday night and I haven’t had any subs since. I’ve been feeling fine honestly so I want to see how long I can make it before physical symptoms kick in and I have to dose again. I have a basic knowledge of half life and all that but these circumstances seem too specific for me to really judge. I’d guess I’d start feeling something tomorrow, day 6?

Can I get off 4mg in 6 weeks taking 1mg of klonopin a day to help sleep and anxiety?

Is six weeks too fast? Could I do it in a month?

I have used subs in the past but only for a couple days. I had no withdrawals and consumed three 8/2 films in a two day period. Am I in too deep to stop while im ahead? Should I expect withdrawls? Should I taper with the remaining films? I do not want to be dependent on this medication as the with-drawls seem intense and horrendous.
