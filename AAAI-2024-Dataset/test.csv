"Just started on Bupe today, actually just put the transdermal patch like 10 minutes ago, and what should I expect? Symptoms-wise speaking.. I battle with opioid addiction since 2018 and I‚Äôve been on methadone management since then (the pills not the liquid) and recently we were planning to switch to Bupe, stay on it for while (months, not years. Because when I was on methadone it took a little while, years, to switch.) and then treat with a mild craving-treatment medicine and quit cold turkey basically.

So, I wanna know how I will feel with this new medication I‚Äôm on: Bupe. The pros, the cons, and can you relapse on it by any means?

"Drug testing question. Hello everyone!

Had a question about drug testing. What kind of consistency does your program's staff test you for controlled substances? I was going on 2 months without the whizz-quiz being so much as mentioned, then this past week's visit was given a urinalysis and blood and saliva test one after another in so many minutes. I knew it would turn out fine but blood, piss and spit too? Has anyone had a similar experience?

Also, they knew I was taking Temezapam for sleep but praised me for not having methamphetamine or cocaine in my system. Didn't even ask me for a script number and I had one ready anyway. (of course.) Anything similar happen to you?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Inpatient Rehab Question. I‚Äôm going to a 28 day rehab facility this week. I‚Äôve been on Suboxone for 8 years, started at 1mg s day (split in two doses) and currently on 2mg (split up in to 4 doses). I‚Äôve done great on my time on subs. I‚Äôve been clean the whole time and it treated my depression, anxiety and bipolar II really well. But due to recent events, I feel it‚Äôs time to come off this medication. I‚Äôm choosing rehab so they can help me manage my withdrawals, but more importantly, I need to dig deep and face my demons I‚Äôve been running from. There are other reasons. I want to start dating and most people have a negative view towards subs. It‚Äôs expensive. Plus I think 8 years is long enough band I want to see what it‚Äôs like to feel like my old self. 

Now to my question. Does anyone have any experiences they can share that involves a 28 day inpatient program? Good or bad, I‚Äôd like to hear it. I know for some subs are the only way to go and I totally respect that. But mine has always been more about depression and anxiety more than drug use. Although the two are usually correlated.

"Kratom to Suboxone? Dosage and questions, please help!. I know a lot of people might not like the fact I replaced kratom with suboxone, but I used to be taking 70 grams of kratom per day, I was dosing every 2-3 hours and practically carrying a pound of green powder everywhere I went. The suboxone lasts a whole day, and I can measure my dose way better since I'm taking the films.

I started with quitting kratom completely and taking 2mg of suboxone, I experienced no withdrawals during the switch but also no high which is good i guess. Today I'm down to 1.5mg of suboxone, and im so happy! Planning to go down to 1.25mg pretty soon too. My question ig is exactly how many gpd of kratom is equal to 1.5mg of suboxone?

"If you use a telemed service that ships urine tests directly to your house, there are steps you can take to protect yourself in the event that they‚Äôre never shipped or lost in transit.. I‚Äôve read a ton of posts in this sub that go something like this: ‚ÄúMy provider asked me to take a urine test and upload a picture to the app, but I never received my shipment of tests in the mail. My appointment is tomorrow and I‚Äôm really worried that I‚Äôm going to be cut off‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm new to doing MAT online and haven‚Äôt had any problems so far, but I wanted to make sure my tush was covered just in case something like this ever happened to me. I also wanted to share this here with the hope that it means one less thing to worry about for anyone here. MAT has saved my life more than once, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said it didn‚Äôt come with the nagging fear that one small hiccup outside of my control could turn my life upside down all over again. Anyway, I‚Äôll stop rambling and get to my point:

USPS offers a free service called ‚ÄúInformed Delivery‚Äù. They email you each morning with front and back pictures of every envelope/piece of mail arriving that day. The email doesn‚Äôt include packages or boxes, but if you log directly into their website or app, every single package that is addressed to your home (including a tracking number and information on the sender) will appear there the moment a shipping label is created. This will allow you to verify if the tests were even sent in the first place. If they were lost in transit, you‚Äôll be able to see where they ended up or if they ultimately went back to your provider. You can even view packages that were shipped months ago 

If you keep an eye on this and take screenshots as needed (or even better, screenshare with your provider/show them on another device during your video call), this will cover your butt so the liability doesn‚Äôt fall on you. If you‚Äôre hiding the fact that you‚Äôre in MAT from people you live with there‚Äôs no need to worry, this info is only accessible to the person that created the account. They don‚Äôt mail you anything to confirm your enrollment in the service.

I‚Äôm not sure if UPS or FedEx offers a similar service, but many packages shipped via those services will end up in USPS‚Äôs hands at some point in the shipping process (and their Informed Delivery system as a result) anyway, because USPS has a more robust delivery infrastructure and handing packages off ends up being cheaper for FedEx/UPS. 

If your packages are getting stolen, that‚Äôs an entirely different story and unfortunately, the liability would unfortunately fall on you. If this is your issue, I would talk to your provider about instructing USPS to hold your package at your local post office until you can pick it up, or invest in a lock box. 

I hope this helps someone! Let me know if you have any questions.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Extremely slow taper. I've decided to not set a date for the finish line but rather work on taking the least amount of medication possible. I'm down to 0.66mg and don't notice much of anything in terms of withdrawal. Yesterday I didn't feel like I needed my dose and went the full day without it until evening. That's a first. 

After 10+ years of opioid abuse, I think the best thing is to not rush and end up putting myself in a situation where I relapse. The medication is certainly strong and doing something meaningful for cravings. I never think about illicit opiates, meds, pods or kratom. It has been 2+ years since I relapsed on anything.

Anyway, I imagine I'll need a long time to comfortably adjust from 0.66mg to 0mg. Or maybe I get to 0.25mg and stay there forever. Maybe I get to 0.125mg and let that be a mental crutch until I find myself forgetting to dose. I know myself and nothing good has ever come from trying to be totally clean.

"BIGGEST PET-PEEVES in Therapy/Counseling. Hey guys was just talking with a buddy in recovery and we got to talking about how we feel about therapy etc.. I expressed my obvious appreciation for therapy for venting and actually knowing that speaking to a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù which is super helpful for my anxiety.

Like big key details, not the name of your cat or color of your car, I‚Äôm not that stupid I know these people have a bunch of clients but still, you think that after going for 6 months or so they‚Äôd remember your relationship status or where you work or have some relative idea . This is referring to frequent appointments to be clear , like two-four times a month appointments.  Idk maybe that‚Äôs just me.

Or when it seems that they‚Äôre just going down a line of questions they have to ask us ‚Äúcrazies‚Äù. This has been extremely prominent in over the phone appointments for a few friends as well.  I feel that sometimes these people forget the weight of their jobs and how this may be the last person someone tries to talk to and get help.

"Question about witdrawls. So I've been on subs for over 8 years now, started at 24, and kept my script there the entire time but only took 8 mg.  I have 2 seizure disorders as well and my Dr who wrote my sub and Xanax prescription recently had to leave for personal reasons.  I've only taken 8 mgs per day the entire time I've had my script, and have titrated down to 1 every 3 days, then half every 3 days, then half every 7.  Now I'm 5 days off, and taking kratom and my titrated Valium dose(10 mgs 2 times a day; compared to 2mg.of  Xanax 3 times a day).  I also have a script for 800mg Gabapentin waiting to be picked up.  My question is using these medications to kind of ease the withdrawals, how long do they typically last, and how bad are they?  I know buprenorphine has an extremely long affinity, and compounds on your receptors which results in a type of delayed withdrawal process.  Should I save my other medications until I start feeling like complete shit, or what?  I'm just asking for general help, and others experiences on detoxing after long term use? Thank you, and to those staying sober, even using subs; I'm proud of you.",0,0,0,1,1,0
"8 1/2 months Suboxone free.. Just a little testimonial for y‚Äôall! 10 years ago a doctor put me on 24mg of subs to come off of Oxy‚Äôs. Literally do not ask why so high of a dose because I could not tell you. I was naive and looking for help and didn‚Äôt know any better. Anyway, I didn‚Äôt want to be on this shit forever and decided I wanted off of it. However the doctor was like you will need to taper and that‚Äôll take a year. I basically was like no way in hell am I going to be on this shit another year. I want to be perfectly clear that for TEN YEARS, I was on 24mg daily and NEVER missed a dose. Period. I‚Äôm a 35 year old female as well with two children so I‚Äôm no spring chicken! So, On 5/27/21 I flew to a detox facility and they did a rapid taper and I took my very last Suboxone ever in my life on 6/4/21. It was the most agonizing lengthy withdraw I‚Äôve ever experienced. Different from opiates. It wasn‚Äôt intense like opiates it was painful but loooooong. It took me 6-7 months to start to feel better, but I did it. I could not have done it without God being at the center of my life and a support system that carried me. 

Withdraws for lesser doses typically don‚Äôt last as long as mine did. You have to remember me coming off 24mg was a CHOICE, I made with knowledge of the consequence of longer withdraw. 

I‚Äôm here to tell you that if I can do it you can to! One thing I always recommend is never comparing yourself to others. I would read peoples experiences and it would defeat me.

"Tapering: What to expect when you're expecting (withdrawals)?. So I'm on a taper, one which is slower than I like, but at least it's progress. I went from 4mg to 1,8mg in about four or five weeks. I'm not at 1,6mg and will go down to 1,4 in one week. Then 1mg after two weeks, and so on. (My physician forgot to send me the taper schedule, but I think it's about 0.4mg for each step). This is temgesic 0,4mg (which means going faster than the schedule means trying to cut a tiny round pill in half...)  
Basically I wanna know what I can expect from other people who have tapered. Is there a big chance I'll still get violently sick? Shakes? Cramps? Cold sweats? I was optimistic because so far it's been going surprisingly great, no real worries except feeling a bit blue, but I also know the closer you get to 0 the worse it gets.   
Is there a chance I wont get suicidal wd's? Is it physically possible that I'll feel like I feel now (bad but manageable with proper diet and exercise) or am I fooling myself? Any experience with temgesic? I know people claim different results from suboxone and subutex, and though I doubt it, is it the same with temgesic?

"I have no flair to add just desperation. I hope this make sense cause I struggle with expressing what's going on with me and never seek help or know how to word things. It's like a block when words need to be used. 

I hate to beat a dead horse but I'm at a crossroad and feel hopeless lost. I'm 34 and been using everything but mostly opiates since 13 or 14. Anything else I used was to try and get off opiates. I've had 2.5 years clean and that's it. I don't use like anyone else I know or have met. I bet lots of us think that but it's probably more a delusion.

I'm in a constant state of self-medicating. I use to work and deal with life and my business, mostly to stay not sick and find small portions of motivation between the push to get through the day. Every morning I push it as far as I can without using and I am so tired I'm ready to just give up. I cringe knowing that I just type that cuz it sounds so cliche. I've done this my entire life and know nothing else. Without I'm too depressed to function. 

This may or may not be important information: I have a deep drive that makes me keep pushing, and have built a decent sized business in the midst of all this. I have ""stuff"" and everything in my life is tied to me pushing beyond what I feel I can do everyday. I cry now knowing how fucked I am. 

Harder stuff when younger (took methadone to get through highschool) then I'd try softer stuff to regulate. Trams worked good for this with about 5 years of that. Then kratom and trams, then kratom only. Then loperamide to help get off kratom, it doesn't end I'm about to restart the same cycle for the millionth time. I'm probably sounding like a broken record and no idea why I'm explaining this is so much detail. 

I can get through WD over and over again it's the days and weeks that follow with emptiness and depression and lack of motivation that take me out. I'm sure with major clinical depression I'd check every box but nothing works besides ops. If I could put together a couple months and work on mental health, imagine things would change to a bearable state. My brain is wired for something at this point and I either keep going as is, Lose everything from lack of motivation and try to get healthier, or try something new.

"RLS FML. So I‚Äôm at the end of a pretty short taper from 4mg to 0.5mg. This taper took 5 weeks and I was on 0.5mg for just 6 days when I jumped. Ideally the taper would‚Äôve been longer and less aggressive but it‚Äôs very difficult for me to get subs and I had a limited supply for this taper. 
60 hours after my last 0.5mg dose I was going insane with the restless legs syndrome. It felt like RLS inducing juice was being poured into my body and affecting every part of it.

 My knees (mainly), and my elbows, wrists, ankles and lower back were all affected. The rls was so strong that it was causing the affected areas to spasm on their own whenever I was able to resist the urge to move them. 

Remaining still for longer than 5-10 seconds was extremely difficult. I had to use all my mindfulness meditation skills to resist the urge to move and the urges were coming in constant waves. I was sitting on a crowded train during some of this and I had to get off the train and wait 30 mins for the next one (twice) because I was going insane being amongst a crowd. 

Sleep was impossible. I only had valerian and chamomile to help with sleep which had no affect but I don‚Äôt want to use any chemical formulas to help me through this if possible. 

In desperation for sleep I started searching through my old stash hideaways looking for a stray sub film. I‚Äôd already done this when I started my taper so I would know exactly how much I had in order to plan my taper. I‚Äôd also repeated the search nearing the end of the taper once it became clear I was going to be uncomfortable stepping off from 0.5mg. During these searches of my room I had a nagging feeling that there was a strip or two hiding somewhere. 

 In a small box that had somehow previously gone un-searched I found 13 x 2mg films that must‚Äôve been sitting there for more than a year. I felt like I‚Äôd won the lottery. 
I immediately sliced and took a 0.5mg piece and waited nearly an hour. My frustration at not getting immediate relief caused me to take another 0.5mg piece. That did the trick. The rls stopped, I crashed. I then woke up around 40 mins later and was awake for about 6 hours with that speedy amphetamine feeling bupe can cause. Bupe also causes me to have very vivid dreams (which are actually realistic nightmares of an R and X rated nature) and they reappeared with this obviously too strong 1mg dose. 

Anyway now I have an unexpected supply of 25mg of bupe (12 and a half x 2mg strips of suboxone) and I am able to plan a longer taper from 0.5mg to whatever it takes. I guess it‚Äôll go something like:

 10 days @ 0.500mg. (5mg)

 10 days @ 0.375mg.  (3.75mg)

 10 days @ 0.250mg.  (2.50mg)

 10 days @ 0.200mg (2mg)

 10 days @ 0.150mg (1.5mg)

 10 days @ 0.100mg. (1mg)

10 days @ 0.075mg (0.750mg)

Total used 16.50mg. 

If I‚Äôm successful up to this point I should still have 9mg left to continue the taper if needed. 

My question to anyone in this sub forum who has bothered to read this is this; if I had not found those extra films of sub how long would that RLS have lasted? 

Also has anyone who has experienced severe opiate/buprenorphine withdrawal RLS found that the syndrome is less powerful when a longer taper is used? If I jump from 0.100 mg will the symptoms be of shorter duration than they were at my 0.500mg jump?. 


Any tips for relief from the syndrome would also be appreciated (I‚Äôm not going to use the Parkinson‚Äôs medication that has been successful for others). 

I feel like I can endure any other physical withdrawal symptom this shit throws at me. The RLS feels almost unbearable though and would Likely be the cause of me relapsing back onto opiates if it doesn‚Äôt end.

So my question is, can I still use Heroin in the morning (intravenously) while still taking my 12mg Suboxone in the late a afternoon (so about a 11-12 hour gap). Will I feel the Heroin and get as high as I used to when I hadn't started subs? Is there risk of precipitated withdrawal if I'm using like that everyday or not",0,1,0,1,0,0

"A sword to a dagger (a poem about MAT). They said it would help.. 
they said it would help,
 they said it would help and that life would get better, 
but now 4 years later I'm writing this letter, 
to tell you the truth about M-A-T, 
and what Suboxone truly did to me.
 For years these doctors assured me the best, that Suboxone was better, and safer than the rest. 
But as the years progressed, the same outcome, to the rest.
I was stuck, I am stuck, crying screaming, without feelings or bliss, Fentynal was like candy, compared to quitting this.
4 days off Fentynal, was all it took, a bit of a sweat and a little I shook, but 4 days was all it took and I was clean,
But then my dealer, was released from prison it would seem. 
So back to the dope, and back to the grind, really hoping things would be better this time. 
Until a doctor told me of this miracle drug, that was safer than methadone and wouldnt make me a slug, with no danger or discourse I pushed through, thinking In the end would be honest and true.
4 years later and here I am stuck, with anxiety like hell, and I've run out of luck. 
These doctors tell me for life I could be,
A patient on Suboxone oh what a fucking glee,
I'm now seeing the truth about M-A-T, and how half of these doctors only care about money.
I'd rather be dead than stumble and stagger, because switching from dope to Suboxone is just switching from a sword to a dagger

Beyond the extreme cost, the pharmacist I talked to said that no SC pharmacy will fill an online prescription.  It's against SC law.

I know you have to have a clean test to get a script.

"Dosing once a day or multiple times when tapering?. Since my tapering means my dose is fairly low I'm unsure whether I should be taking the sub just once or twice a day. I was told, a long time ago, that taking your dose in several doses a day contributes to ""drug behavior"" and is detrimental to any recovery. But it seems it's fairly common and my doc had no issue in me doing it when he put up my tapering schedule.  
At some point I will be down to 0.1mg and which point dividing the dose into morning and evening seems pointless so I started taking my 0.4mg dose in the morning rather than 0.2 in the morning and 0.2 in the evening, but was that a mistake?   
YES it means getting used to not taking my dose in the evening which contributes to learning to ""live without"" and it means I get to start the day feeling good and incrementally worse throughout the day (which I can live with) BUT it also seems to mean waking up in the middle of the night with withdrawals...

"Methadone to Suboxone - back to methadone? Possible?. Hello all,

My name is Kristopher and this is my first post. I am a 38 year old Canadian male. I mention Canada because I think there are some significant differences in treatment.

I had a small to moderate addiction after suffering an injury in Afghanistan. I left the military and ended up in a methadone clinic. Within a few months I was stable at 90 MG. After three years I had brought my dose down to 20 MG. (hindsight, I should have continued with the taper).

My Doc had been talking to me about methadone to Suboxone and really convinced me that it was the next step in getting free of the weekly clinic visits. And I am certain that protocol has helped tens of thousands - but it is doing me and my family harm. 

When I started the suboxone I actually found it to work ok. I felt the same as I did on the methadone. I started at an 8mg pill, sublingual. Every visit he kept raising the dose - aiming for 24mg. The issue is that every time I went up I was starting to experience some nasty problems. I am so angry all the time. I am treating my family like garbage and I can't stop it. It's bringing me back to a really bad place. Currently I dropped from 2 pills to one (8 mg). This is day three of dropping one full pill. So far I feel no discomfort. 

I need to discuss this with my Dr. and I will on Thursday. I just want to know if anyone has experienced anything like this? That suboxone made them really ""dark""? I hear people use the term ""dark times"" and I totally get it.

Here are my options as I see them. Please highlight any other options if you see any:

** I completely and quickly taper off the subs and attempt life without.

** I stay on the Subs and eventually lose my family if I can't get out of this rut I am in.

** Now here is the best option as I see it, but don't know if an addiction doc will do it: I go back to a small dose of methadone and taper off like I itially had planned (years back before I knew about subs).

I am not sure what other info I can provide to help get me some good evidence based advice, from the people who know more about this than I do. Ask me anything if you think it can help me. 

Thank you for taking your time to read this. I genuinely appreciate it.

"New to suboxone, fairly happy with results, but afraid results will fade and side effects will be all that remains.. I have a degenerative disease of the spine, had a couple of surgeries, been through numerous procedures, and have taken every non-opiate med on the market to try in an effort to have a somewhat normal life. But, nothing has worked and I have had an 8 year migraine- no breaks. A good day is a level 7 headache and this doesn't include my neck and back issues.

I have used Norco and Percocet for short periods immediately after my surgeries,  but never for more than a few weeks, so I've never developed an addiction. I've grown tired of the pain and told my doctor I need a real pain medicine or I'm going to give up (permanently).

This week I was started on Suboxone. For the first time in 8 years I've woken up without a migraine, which is awesome. But, I've also felt like I was back in college and was on the tail end of fifth of vodka the last bowl of the night. In other words, I feel awesome, but at any second I'm going to nod off and it lasts the entire day.

After 8 years, I much prefer this new feeling to the latter.  But, I'm not looking to feel high. I just want to function and be relatively free of pain.  My question is, will my body adapt to where I can be alert while still getting the pain relief? Or, does the pain relief and euphoria go hand in hand  and both will dissappear?

"HELP! Trying to get on subs after 20+ years of use. Hi team! I am struggling to come off years of opiates for many many years and need some positives vibes and words of wisdom from those of you that have already detached from this horrible drug. For the majority of use I had been using OxyContin/oxycodone daily, for about 15 years. The last five has been street drugs and most recently I had been on methadone but was still using fentadope throughout, so I thought trying to switch to bupe would possibly/hopefully be more effective. I had planned to reduce the amount of methadone I had been taking and did so over the course of March&April and haven‚Äôt used any now for 12 days, however, I still was buying fentadope about 3-4 times a week. The last time I had used anything was the fent Monday morning 11am I‚Äôd say. I woke up today wanting to start the subs so I waiting until 5pm Tuesday, so about 30 hours. I woke up and did have withdrawal today but not terrible. I took 2mg at 5pm, felt ok, then I took 1mg an hour later at 6pm and at that point I started to get worse WD symptoms than I had previously. Waited it out took another 1mg at 7 and no noticeable change, still the worsened WD symptom described previously.

"Using pain killers to get off suboxone?. So. This is going to sound weird, but I actually wasn‚Äôt put on suboxone for opiate dependence. I was put on it 3 years ago because this new age doctor said it could help with my depression by raising my dopamine levels. Anyways long story short. 3 years later I am on testosterone therapy at 28. Because the suboxone killed my T levels so much. My libido/mood/energy/etc is still super up or down even with testosterone therapy. My hormone doctor says that getting off the suboxone would help immensely in making the testosterone work better. I want to get off the suboxone but I heard it‚Äôs worse then opiate withdrawals. Which I have no idea what those are like, but I have heard they are miserable. And I have also heard suboxone withdrawals last longer. I guess my question is, could I stop the suboxone for maybe 3 days. Switch to maybe something like Percocet or Vicodin. Stay on those for maybe 2 months. And by the time the 2 months has passed the suboxone should be totally out of my system and then just stop the painkillers? I know this sounds crazy and stupid. But just wondering if it‚Äôs an option. I feel trapped on this drug. I just feel numb to life at times and I honestly feel like I felt better before I went on it. Thanks for any help.

"I actually hate this drug so much. I‚Äôve been on it for 3 years now and all I take it about 2mg. If I don‚Äôt take it I get bubbles in my stomach going up my throat which is an indication I need more (to fall asleep) if I don‚Äôt I will get rock hard erections, semi to intense nightmares (depending how much dosage I am short of) , obvious insomnia.  

I hate this because I wish I just used it to come off the heroin and didn‚Äôt continue to take it non stop. Anytime I think about stopping and cutting the dosage completely off, I just think well how the hell am I going to do that when I‚Äôm only on a few MG‚Äôs and it‚Äôs going to be up for days sort of thing because #1 I won‚Äôt ever be able to fall asleep, #2 if I do take like a sleep gummy i will be addicted to those and that will force me to sleep meaning I‚Äôll still probably be unable to fall asleep but even more tired and miserable / or have horrible nightmares 

Overall I hate this drug and if anyone has ever related to my side effects please let me know and what you did to come off.

I have heard of people getting addicted and that‚Äôs the only reason I am hesitant but i really would do anything to get off the percs. i‚Äôm 20 and on my dads insurance so he will probably find out about my addiction but that‚Äôs a risk i‚Äôm willing to take. if anyone can give me advice on which treatment program i should try out or if this is a good idea at all- i‚Äôm all ears.,0,0,0,1,0,0

Was a 10+ year oxy/fent user since basically high school through law school and beyond (somehow managed to pass the Bar while in major WDs‚Ä¶will never understand that). 

Oxy (and that fake oxy fent from the street) cost me my job. Moved abroad to Europe where after getting a little better, I got sick again. When docs don‚Äôt know what OxyNorm is and prescribe it naively at 5-10 bucks per package, hard to say no.

Until this past April 2021. OTC codeine. 5 bucks a box. 

Been taking 1800-2400mg per day. Every day. Since April 2021. 

I‚Äôm now on day 6 without codeine. 

The problem is two fold:

1. Day 1 of detox is day 1 of COVID. How‚Äôs that for luck? Triple vaccinated and my kid brings it home from school. This sucks not because of COVID (sorry but not my priority right now!)‚Ä¶it sucks because it‚Äôs so hard to distinguish between COVID symptoms and WD symptoms. (I am triple vaxxed and my symptoms lean more towards WD symptoms and not COVID like symptoms, but I‚Äôm no doctor). 

2. I‚Äôm basically ‚Äústabilized‚Äù at 1mg of Buprex per day (no naloxone). Sometimes I take 1.2mg. Sometimes point 8.  

I know less is more. But the problem is ‚Ä¶ and I can‚Äôt tell if this is just my junkie mentality or COVID ‚Ä¶. But I just don‚Äôt feel better. The only thing stopping me from getting out of bed for codeine is the fact I know the bupe is blocking any potential high. My RLS is still all day every day. I‚Äôm still in full body pain. I still have anxiety. And my sleep is shit. Dehydrated, lazy, can‚Äôt move, etc. 

I‚Äôm rambling but I guess I‚Äôm asking ‚Ä¶ should I just be miserable on 1mg and wait and see? Should I give 2mg a shot one day to see if my symptoms go away? How bad will it mess up my tolerance or potential taper if one day I take an extra mg of subs?

I really just wanna know if I need more subs to feel better, and if I do, will it kill me to try 2mg one day and go back to 1mg the next (meaning, if I find out 2 isn‚Äôt any better help). 

Thanks for any help. I really just don‚Äôt think my issues are COVID related given how fucking vaxxed I am + my wife and kids who also have COVID at the same time feel great. 

FWIW, people who trash talk codeine as being weak ‚Ä¶ I get it. I really do. Just know hell is relative and opiates are opiates. I‚Äôve done the oxys and fent laced presses and the fent patches and sniffed H. I see how some look down on codeine. But it‚Äôs hard man. It‚Äôs hard. To each their own.

"Suboxone doctor contradiction.. Just want to add this point to my recent post about not being able to get on Suboxone because ""shy bladder"".

Thing is I was prescribed methadone and clonazepam. 80mg methadone 6mg clonazepam a day for 10 years. 4 years ago got terminated by that doctor for not being able to pee. 
 Now this is contradictions to me, first off it's very hard to od on benzos and Suboxone. Especially being monitored weekly and having no reason to fuck up my treatment. So doctor says no benzos on Suboxone. So I'm risking death and seizures to get on just Suboxone and quit benzo Cold turkey. I think it's much more risk to go cold turkey like that than the chance I'll od on Suboxone.

I began taking suboxone again about a month ago at 1mg as I often get really bad side effects on this medication including feeling dead inside, not caring about anything, cranky, don't want to talk to people, have no passion or desire for anything while on suboxone.

I started on a low dose to avoid these side effects as experienced on higher doses in the past as much as possible and I feel pretty stabilized at 1mg but I am still feeling many of these side effects at a reduced level.

I am basically trying to get to that point and have been not taking it for a few days then trying 0.5mg for a few days to slowly get my tolerance down and adjusted but I have been getting alot more anxiety at 0.5mg and feel it kinda seems to somewhat wear off throughout the day (I don't go into any physical withdrawals just feel sketchy mentally).

I am just wondering if anyone has any insights into how long it should take to stabilize at 0.5mg or if that's even possible?

I want to believe you can stabilize at 0 5mg as some people have posted alot of success at this very low dose...

 but I also read people who say you'll never stabilize at that low of a dose which is rather discouraging and I am just looking for some hope that it can be done and work well.

Due to being overwhelmed, I have taken 3mg a day in order to keep myself from the edge of relapse. I decided I should tell my doctor about this instead of running out early every single month and struggling to make it until that next refill date. Luckily my appointment is early this month so I won't have to deal with going through withdrawals. Do you think my doctor will understand and up my dose? If it matters, I have passed every single drug test and have had a good relationship with this doctor.",1,0,1,0,0,0
"61 days sub free!. Sorry I haven‚Äôt updated as much as I should, but I started a new software job the second week off and I work a tooonnn. 

Good news is after the first couple weeks, I felt like all the withdrawal symptoms were gone. I jumped off .25mg, had tried jumping at 2mg a few months before and that was hell so I had to go back on and taper more. 

By week 3 even the chills/sweats and goosebumps were gone! My sleep is completely normal now, although I still take trazadone. I was always able to sleep at least 5-6 hours with the trazadone the first few weeks. 

I‚Äôm not longer taking any comfort meds, but did take Gabapentin consistently 3x a day for the first 5ish week, which I know really helps. I barely took clonidine, only a few times those first couple weeks. I don‚Äôt feel depressed either, although I think my mental situation would be different if I didn‚Äôt have a job to focus on. 

Seriously having a new job and diving into it was the best thing for getting off subs. Completely distracted me from the minor withdrawals I had. 

I feel joy again and enjoy all the things in life subs robbed me from! I promise guys‚Ä¶you can do it! I highly recommend tapering down to at least .25mg before jumping. Best wishes!",0,0,0,0,1,0

Backround: Ive been on subs for about 3-3.5 weeks at this point, and when i told my doc that i recduced and want to be on a lower amount she began bringing up switching me to Subzolv instead of the film if my insurance will cover it.

I really want to reduce even further until i am on 2mg-4mg tops a day, i deally id like to be eve lower, but ill accept what i have to do.

Myquestion tho is can they tell i havent been taking my full amount and could they kick me off for it? Like is it an exact science?

Also what are some excuses i can use if they question me about it, i really dont want to lie but i dont want to be kicked off subs completly at this point because i have way too much going on rn with life and bills and such.

1-2 stool softeners (50 or 100mg each )

2 tbsp milk of magnesia (if I‚Äôm feeling pressure of being backed up )
1 tbsp olive oil

"Day 10 jumping from 2mg. Hey guys, just wanted to give an update on my journey. I am nearly done w/ day 10 jumping off 2mg subs, and I was on 4-2mg for a couple years. In days 4-7 I was in really bad shape. At certain points of the day all I could do was sit in a fetal position on my bed in agony. Tried to get my mind off things by playing video games but I just couldn't do it. You know that shitty feeling where your body is restless but your mind is tired af? Yeah it was like an extreme version of that. Sitting down felt like shit but I was simultaneously too tired to move my body. Had practically 0 appetite and my digestive system was in a knot. My sense of temperature was completely fucked too, I'd feel super hot one moment and then freezing the next. For comfort meds I've been using alprazolam (i normally don't take benzos), kratom (plan to stop that in a few days from now), magnesium supplements, and melatonin for sleep.

But after last night, I started to feel much better. And tonight I feel SO much better, physically speaking. Someone commented on my last post that day 10 is where things can really turn around for the better and they were 100% right. I'm still tired but all that aching and wanting to jump out of my skin feeling has subsided like 90%. A few days ago, whenever I'd take Kratom, it would only give me relief for like 1 hour and then I would feel the sub WDs again. But today even without Kratom I don't feel that bad. I also slept last night for 6 hours straight which was really good considering nights before that I couldn't sleep for more than 3 hours increments before the WDs would wake me up. Also got in a good workout today which I believe helped.

My physical symptoms atm really just consist of: light lethargy, yawning, sniffles, diarrhea, and a tiny bit of RLS at certain times. Not even as bad as a light cold tbh at this point. Like I said, as far as physical WDs go, I feel they're about 90% reduced in intensity. Today is the first full day where I truly felt like I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. On day 5-6 ngl there were moments where I almost wanted to die. Never been suicidal and I have a lot to live for, but I just couldn't imagine enduring a whole month of that bs. Thank god things are really finally turning around. I think after just a couple more days, the battle will be basically purely psychological.

This is definitely the longest I've gone without subs in years and I am proud of that. Last time I tried going CT from 10mg and only lasted until day 6. I know I could've tapered lower this time but situations happened to where I had to jump from 2mg, and tbh tapering was always quite challenging for me anyways. Still, if you can, always try to taper to the lowest possible dose, of course.

I am just so glad to be on my way to be off this stuff. I am just ""feeling"" things a lot more and I don't feel as numb.

My doctor will not fucking detox me as fast as I've asked him to, he's only dropping me 2mg every 3 months, so on my own i've gone from 12mg to .5mg in the past 6 months.

Doctor strongly suggesting I switch from suboxone to methadone (worries) PLEASE HELP!. Hey guys I've continuously told my doctor that suboxone hasn't helped with my cravings just the physical wd since I started it 5 months ago.  These past few weeks she's been telling me to give methadone a try.  I've expressed my worries about methadone and its long half-life but she says getting off will be painless with a slow taper.  I've heard from others that even with a slow taper they constantly feel mildly sick for months on end before finally completely getting off.  I also don't think it's as easy as she says to just try it for a week and if I don't like it get back on suboxone without any withdrawal.  She says you can microdose suboxone in place of the next dose of methadone which won't cause precipitated wd but I just don't trust it with the long half-life.

"Hi guys, I'm new here, considering getting on subs.. Title pretty much says it all, I'm a fellow human struggling with his dysfunctional relationship with opiates.

Brief background: Tried Vicodin at 15, instantly fell in love. Graduated to OC 80s by high school, but never became dependent, simply because I couldn't support the habit

Was shown how to smoke black tar in college, and that was game over. Been struggling big time ever since. Developed a really bad dependence in 2015 which I went to rehab for, and amassed **6 years of clean time**. Never used any kind of maintenance therapy.

Covid happened, enter relapse. 

My entire 2021 has been nothing but relapses. I think I have relapsed 6 times this year, and I just keep failing despite the efforts to stay clean, at times, I feel like I simply cannot. I feel like I have lost control of myself, and literally cannot keep from texting my dealer and picking up.

I've never seriously considered getting on Subs until now. So here's my question to you:

What has your experience been like with subs? Pros/Cons? Would you recommend I go on them, based on my situation? Honestly at this point, I'm not even opposed to being on them for long term. I am much happier when there are opiates in my system.

I was curious as to what type of success people have with them and roughly what kind of dose I would need with my habit. It‚Äôs been going on for about 6-7 years or so. 

Im so ready to be fucking done. I need help and me just getting to make this appt and talk to a medical professional about it is giving me soo much hope. 

Please tell me your thoughts. Thank you all! I‚Äôm ready to reclaim my life!!!",0,1,0,0,1,0
"Terrified of the dentist. My teeth were never perfect but dear lord suboxone has destroyed them. I made it threw a decade of drug use and had a pretty smile. 4 years of suboxone and I‚Äôm spitting out chunks of teeth. I can barely eat because of the pain and just general fear of ‚Äúwill this next bite be a mixture of food and tooth?‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs time to goto the dentist. I‚Äôve put this off because of fear. Once you say suboxone to a medical professional, in my experience, comes with anything from judgmental looks, a lecture or down right disrespect. My ENT appointment was traumatizing and I left crying. So I‚Äôve stupidly stayed away from the dentist. My medication isn‚Äôt something I can keep to myself obviously they have to know. 

I don‚Äôt know how to handle this. I don‚Äôt even know if I can afford this. I‚Äôm scared shitless. Has anyone else had this experience? How bad was the pain of recovery with no pain meds? I need to do something because I want to gain weight (Pre suboxone I was 135ish now I‚Äôm stuck at 108) and not be in pain. 

Any advice or words of encouragement would be awesome. I don‚Äôt like to talk about it with friends because I‚Äôm embarrassed.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Is there a way to Seperate/Remove the Nalaxone from suboxone?. I am not asking this for abusive intentions, I am simply curious how pure bup would effect me without naloxone. I have heard off naloxone being responsible for headaches and other side effects which I experience. I am aware of subutex. But is there a way to isolate the bup? If not is there a way to decrease the bioavailability/absorption of naloxone without affecting the bup? I have heard that not swallowing the sub will not let the naloxone absorb as much.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"Massive fear setting in with final taper approaching. I tapered from 10MG to 3MG over a few months with no problem.  I'm now down to 2.5 and starting to feel some effects for the first time.  Nothing major, but enough to remind me of what's coming.  And every single freakin post i see lately is about what an absolute nightmare it is once you get under 2mg, and then the first few weeks getting off, and then the months after that.  It's like horror story after horror story.  I have an extremely busy job, a wife, kids, a very full life.  It feels like i have 6 months of absolute hell in front of me and it's really starting to fuck with me.  I know i need to focus on today, ignore the horror stories, etc, but it's all so real now.  I eat well and exercise and go to meetings and have a full, meaningful life, and I'm hoping all of that mitigates some of the pain of withdrawal, but it feels inescapable.

"Dr moving me to suboxone (Says it's stronger). My doctor asked me to move over to suboxone from Espranor (Buprenorphine only). He says espranor absorbs poorly and suboxone (Tablets) absorb much better and provides an accurate dose.

I told him this is false and espranor has a higher bioavailability. I read this online. He says that's wrong and says suboxone is better and your dose needs to be lowered. I know it's actually a cost saving method and refused to listen to my story.

It's dropping by 2mg which is fine with me but why is he lying about the absorption issue?

Do all these meds absorb similarly and will I notice that 2mg. Also suboxone contains naloxone which I've heard has various issues.

"5 Days on Sublocade - So Far, So Good. So I am on my 5th full day after my first Sublocade shot, which was on Thursday. 

The first day after the shot I was quite intoxicated and sleepy, which I posted about, but I later deleted my post because I didn't want to scare people. I had also taken a Sudafed that morning which I believe messed me  up more than normal. Slept like a log this night.

Days 2-3: feeling kind of ""flat,"" a bit tired and forgetful. almost intermittently in some kind of w/d's. Wondering if this could be from the naloxone leaving my body. Good riddance! Didn't sleep well either night. 

Days 4-5 - energy rising, I'm starting to feel better. I'm proud that I haven't needed to supplement with any films and it is SUCH a great feeling to not have to pop those nasty films in my mouth twice a day. My energy feels more stable and I slept very well last night. 

Regarding the injection - the needle itself did not hurt but right after she injected me it burned like hell for about 5 seconds. And then burned intermittently a few more times that day, each time with less intensity. My injection site is still bruised and somewhat swollen. I have a small amount of belly fat but I look like I have quite the pot belly on the side where I was injected, which is odd. Can this stuff cause water retention, I wonder?  I have not pressed down to see if I can feel the implant, it's still sore there and it weirds me out to do so. 

Stats - was on 3mg for the last 5 years, but was on varying doses since 2010, so I am a long timer. If this ends up working and getting me off this stuff, I will be psyched. This first shot was 100 mg, will likely go back for 1 more and then I'm hoping to be done.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"Dr. Reddy's VS. Sandoz Brand. Good morning all. This is going to be more of a rant post as I'm at wits end with my local pharmacy and this Dr. Reddy's brand of strips. For the past 2 months the pharmacy that I'm locked into; which I don't fully understand because I'm a self pay client and not Medicaid or any insurance company that locks me into only one pharmacy. It's my clinic I go to who is locking me to one pharmacy. Up till a couple months ago I was getting the Sandoz brand, which is pretty much identical to the brand name. The generic is all I can afford being self pay by the time I pay the clinic bill; which too, is another matter entirely that I'll mention later. 

Enter Dr. Reddy's brand strips...awful, just awful. I can dose at 7 am in the morning before work and by 5 pm it feels as if I'd skipped a dose. They don't even dissolve as well as the other generic brand and I get a mild headache after dosing with them. My Dr. even requested the Sandoz brand and NOT the Dr. Reddy's brand and even explained why I didn't want them. Fast forward to the time to go pick them up...I go in as I normally do, ask for my prescription, present my ID and pay out the Ying Yang for 56 strips, go to walk out but before I do, it hits me to look in the bag and look in my bottle...Damned Dr. Reddy's brand strips again. I say ah Hell no and politely ask to speak to the pharmacist who filled this crap. He asks what the issue is and I explain the situation while he's already shaking his head in disagreement then cuts me off claiming there's no difference in the Sandoz and Dr Reddy's brand strips except for the names and design, they do what they're made to do. I disagreed and said you can say that because you aren't on this medication and have to take it on a daily basis. He says, it's all we carry now in the generic because they're the same. By this time I already knew where this was heading so now I was getting aggravated and said you're pharmacy is using them because they are dirt ass cheap and you can buy them cheap, then sell each strip at the maximum you can get out of them and make a killing. I asked for my money back and just to cancel the prescription that I didn't want them and wasn't going to pay them hundreds of dollars for a product that was trash. For those of you who aren't aware, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Dr. Reddy's brand strips has been sued for potency issues before. They are a company out of India known for making cheap priced generics, then selling them overseas at a huge profit but non benefit to many who have the misfortune of getting them. Anyway, the pharmacy refused to refund my money using a policy that I had opened the bag therefore they don't have to refund my money excuse. So, I made it clear I would be taking my business elsewhere after 6 years of this being my pharmacy and having the attitude about me questioning his expertise then asking for my money back. So now I'm stuck once again with a brand that I can absolutely 100% without a doubt, tell a considerable difference in throughout the day, after taking it. Between this situation and what I consider my clinic screwing me on what they are charging me, I'm getting aggravated and just want to come off this shit altogether. 

My clinic, is charging me $436 a month for services not being rendered. Most clients there, especially newer ones have to have 4 hrs of groups including face time with a counselor. Where I've been there so long, I do not. I have one hour a month, see the Dr. and that's it. This month, due to the COVID-19 outbreak our state has pulled the switch on people going to the clinic for any groups or sessions whatsoever. I've only had to have one hour a month for the past three months after being grandfathered in on a new thing they're doing with senior clients with 5 years or more. My understanding is, there are only seven of us that qualified for this. Cool, fine. However, they're charging us full price of $436 a month out of pocket. It's $108 a week if you're weekly, which requires 4 hrs a month of facetime and groups if you're newer client. I approached the people who are involved with taking the payment weekly or monthly and asked if there should be some type of pro-rated prices to clients not having these extra services rendered and I was told, ""We have to treat everyone here the exact same and to cut cost of your monthly fee would feel like we're showing favoritism among clients."" Whaaa? Tell me that drug addiction doesn't pay. It pays them and companies take full advantage of addicts. 

Sorry for such a long post and congrats to those who stuck around to read it. It's just that at this time, I find myself growing frustrated with recovery and the current situation with my pharmacy, brand of medication and the clinic I go to. I'm certain that I can surely can't be the only one who feels this way or has felt this way at some point.",1,1,1,0,0,0

"Experience with ant-depressents or supplements?. Hey all, I have been on subs for a year now and I can see what everyone is talking about that the effect changes long term.. I dont get that rush of energy in the morning when I take it.. but perhaps its because I lowered my dose from 12 to 7mg gradually. 

One thing I discovered that helps a lot is magnesium... it helps me shit regularly but more important than that... i end up actually having somewhat of an appetite now too.  Before I was in a terrible cycle where i wouldn't get hungry, feel all bloated, and then get a geadache/cranky and lose productivity and even get depressed when I didn't eat.

"Suboxone Taper Help. Looking for some help  on tapering. I‚Äôve gotten my dosage down to a very low amount something around 0.5mg. I actually use subutex so it‚Äôs a pill and a little harder to measure exactly. Like today for example I ended up taking a little bit more than normal, which prob ended up being 2x normal amount. Had a little bit of withdrawal feeling in the am took a small piece and didn‚Äôt get much relief so I took more but should‚Äôve waited. 

Anyways my nose got very itchy, spaced out, etc. Does anyone have any recommendations for continuing the taper properly? Was wondering if I could forego taking it for a 24-48 hours, and try to do a methadone detox. Open to any suggestions.

"Question. So, I'm about 2 months into my subs. The first week and a half, I was fine. Then I started getting daily headaches, and I've had chronic migraines for a decade. Obviously when I was using I rarely had one, I was abusing opiates lmao I didn't feel anything. But I never had them nearly as frequently. I talked to my doc, they're having trouble getting me a medication that works for headaches that my insurance will cover and that won't interfere with the subs and my constant low blood pressure. But I really just think it's a side effect of my insanely high dose of subs. I take 2 8/2 mg pills a day. Nothing to complain about except headaches and (duh) constipation. I asked to lower my dose, docs said no. I've cut it on my own to 1.5 8/2s a day, so I'm at 12 instead of 16 mg, but I still get the headaches. They're indescribable, a million times worse than my old migraines (which I thought were unbearable at the time.) I vomit every time I try to move from the pain in my head if I don't have the right dose of the right medicine. I have a toddler and 2 jobs, I can't keep doing this. Anyone have anything to suggest at all? From cutting my dose I still haven't experienced any withdrawal or craving and it's been almost 2 weeks, but I really am a little scared to cut it anymore. Please chime in if there's a medicine you can recommend or a dose or a way to convey to my doctor this problem NEEDS a solution NOW and not in a few weeks or months or whenever they decide to take me seriously. And for the record, I actually really like my doctor, super cool and understanding, just won't lower my dose because she's afraid of side effects and won't give me 75% of highly recommended headache medicine because it's addictive, it has a warning for bupe, or it has a notice for blood pressure.

"Anyone moving from Methadone to Subutex experience side pains, back pain, or abdominal pain in 1st month of treatment?. üòåTHANKS EVERYONE FOR INPUT! IT REALLY HELPS!üòå

Moved from 40mg methadone daily for 3+ years to 8mg a day on Jan 13th this year. I waited over 72 hours to dose and experienced minor pwds but after about a week they declined. About the 20th of Jan I reduced my dose to 4 mg a day and everything seemed fine until about a week ago when I started to experience pain in my left side, left back side, right side and would experience stomach discomfort akin to indigestion.

I never have had a internal pain like this so I stopped taking the subs for about 36 hours and noticed the pain subsiding somewhat but I started feeling sick of course so rather than take 2mg orally as I had been all along I took 2mg via insuffulation and so far no pain. Thought maybe mucus membranes would help and maybe it was getting into my stomach and kidneys? or liver? ( I know they SAY sublingual ROA is non haptic but your liver still metabolizes it through your blood)

I have had blood work at the Mdone clinic  a few months ago and they said all my labs were ok. I went to urgent care yesterday who thought kidney stones but got a CT scan and came back negative. 

My prescribing Dr. said today he thinks I could still be withdrawing from the MDone and its still interacting with the Subs .....I don't know wtf is going on! I just know I'm not going back to MDone and cant function on nothing!

"Subs have basically ruined my life and I would be very appreciative for guidance and opinions. I should start by admitting that I am fully aware that I am more responsible for ruining my life than Suboxone is, but they seem to go hand in hand. I was diagnosed with a neurological disorder that causes long-term chronic pain; they prescribed oxycodone and I became addicted to it about 15 years ago, at the age of 24. It was a pretty intense addiction to the point where I was taking upwards of 100 mg whenever I could find it and basically spent all of the money I had. I went to rehab and stayed away from pain medicine for a long, long time. In the meantime, from my early 30s through my late 30s, I became a heavy drinker. I would drink about a pint of vodka a night, sometimes almost a fifth on Saturdays but one rule I never broke was that I literally never started drinking before 7:30 p.m., ever. Randomly one night while drinking my buddy had a Suboxone and I gave into temptation and took a small piece of one. It fucked me up fairly good but what it did more than anything was take away my physical pain more than any sort of oxycodone or oxycontin ever did. The next day when I woke up I was kind of skeptical in regard to the pain relief so I chalked it up to me being drunk. He gave me a few more that I took over the next week. I only took them while I was sober, and IT...WAS... LIFE-CHANGING!!! I was able to do things that I had not been able to do for over 10 years. When I say life-changing, I mean literally life-changing: It basically brought back my old life for all intents and purposes. So I went to a Suboxone doctor and lied. Told her I was still hooked on oxycodone so she gave me the suboxone. It was actually shockingly easy to get that prescribed, which I thought was kind of weird but that was my goal so I was okay with it. Everything was great for about 3 months, my life was going great, I was able to pick up some of my old healthy hobbies, it was literally a dream come true. Until one Saturday at noon I had a beer at lunch. I noticed that when I had a beer or two (with a dose or two of Suboxone in my system already) the buzz I got from it was exactly the same as when I was really hooked on oxycodone 15 years ago.




So I started having a beer or two a few times a week, fast forward 6 months and I am now drinking beer on and off throughout the day to the point where it's putting me to sleep when I get home from work. Nobody at work has said anything but I'm pretty sure they can probably tell that I am buzzed half the time. I don't know what to do. Even though I was a heavy drinker in the past, I never drank during the day and it never fucked with my life. But the feeling I get when I drink beer throughout the day with Subs, is strong enough to keep bringing me back to day-drinking. I know I need to quit drinking, but if I give up the Suboxone I'm going to have to give up all the things that I gained back when I started taking it... The ability to ride and own a motorcycle, standing on my feet for longer than 10 minutes, cooking in the kitchen without getting so fatigued I have to sit down after 15 minutes. If someone were to take an honest look and extrapolate that level of pain and fatigue throughout their own life, it will show them just how much it destroys a life. I mean, without the subs, I can't even get through taking a shower without taking numerous breaks to let my muscle fatigue and pain relent. Sorry for the long rant, I just honestly don't know what to do. It's clear that I need to stop drinking, and I have full confidence that I can, I was able to stop the pain medicine in the past, but this feels a little different. I have somehow associated the life-changing pain relief of the subs with the depression relief of the subs combined with the beer and I am completely lost. Any help is seriously really appreciated.

"Clomid for low Testosterone/Sex Drive. Just FYI, if you‚Äôre a male on Subs and experiencing a low sex drive (which I assume many long term users are), Clomid is a fantastic drug.

suboxone vs subutex. So I have a question for anyone with ACTUAL FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE. I've read on here hundreds of times about the bupe being what causes pws not the naloxone so subutex would be no different as far as having to wait until fully in withdrawls to begin treatment. I really question this because at one point my dr prescribed me bupe on top of my oxycodone (butrans patches) and I wore them for a while and they never gave me any pws. Has anyone ever taken SUBUTEX (not suboxone) before being I'm withdrawals? Thanks.,0,1,1,1,0,0

"Anyone else notice a personality change?. I have been on Suboxone (Mine is Buprenorphine only).

That they feel very low and lost alot of their personality? I use to be very humorous and felt more loving with my partner where as now I feel very flat. Lowered sex drive and lost alot of my sense of humour.

Would subs (Buprenorphine) be causing this? If so does anyone know why?

I have a theory and it's just that... A theory.

Buprenorphine has been shown to partially agonise the mu opioid receptor and in turn releases dopamine. Over time with this continued use the dopamine receptors become down regulated. Now we do release dopamine but the receptors are so down regulated that we feel the usual low dopamine symptoms. Low mood ' Low sex drive' Zero drive in life.

I may be completely wrong but it seems a reasonable idea.

Anyone else notice these issues and found a way of being able to regain some of their old self? The thought of quitting gives me the absolute fear. I work in a hard going job and genuinely couldn't handle any form of withdrawal. Especially since how I feel just now.

"Sharing my story.   I have been abusing opiates since 2012.

Fast forward to last year my little brother passed away tragically and I couldn‚Äôt find any subs, so someone gave me my first hit of H and I was hooked, line and sinker. For the past 5 months I have been on an endless binge. Overdosed in December and still didn‚Äôt GAF. Spending every last dollar I had, all while miraculously keeping my job and apartment.
   Last Tuesday I had enough, made myself an appointment, left work, and began withdrawing. 48 hours later and I was able to take the first sub. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve had a prescription for it, and the first time in years I haven‚Äôt felt like I need to run and get something every time I wake up.

"Metabolism. Metabolism

Anyone else get deemed a fast metabolizer? My clinic didn‚Äôt believe I was taking my dose properly, I got accused of getting rid of my med. I told them to test me and I‚Äôll prove what‚Äôs going on. They did, and now they trust me and don‚Äôt even acknowledge my levels when I go in. Curious if anyone else is a fast metabolizer? If so, do you split your dose up or take it all at once?

"Bupe.me Didnt give me enough meds??? NEED ADVICE!!. I signed up with bupe.me and had a doctors visit today and got suboxone prescribed to me. I take 16mg daily where I buy them off the streets, but the doctor would only prescribed me 8mg per day (14 day supply w/ refill, even though i paid for the 1 month of treatment) but I know that 8mg isn't gonna be enough to hold me over. I explained that to the doctor but they didnt listen and said they're only starting me on 8mg because they don't think I need 16mg. 

Ive taken 16mg a day for 1 and a half years. My opiate history is I got addicted at 15 with hydros and oxys and kept taking more n more then switched to kratom and was taking doses of like 65g a day at max, and i was still using opiates all the time. I then switched over to Tianeptine and reached 4g a day doses and when i stopped tia I started taking subs from the streets. I basically worked my way up to 16mg because i wanted to completely block my receptors so I dont have temptation if that makes sense.

The DR said they doubt that 8mg once a day wouldn't be enough but Im almost positive it wont be enough .

What do i do? The DR said that I only meet with them every 3 months. How can I get my dose upped. I really need this and I don't think they quite understood everything of my opiate history ....

I also got prescribed generics because I can't afford non generic. Generic subs have always felt like they're weaker... 

I feel like im getting fucked here... please help and advise is highly appreciated... Thank you for reading",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Needing motivation to drop down to 6 mg from 8 mg. I'd been doing pretty good using only 6 mg from an 8 mg prescription. Well, my mom died Thursday and I pretty much knew it was coming, so I had given myself permission to go back up to 8 mg. I also used 10 mg and 12 mg on a couple of days. 

I'm also craving benzos, which I got off of this summer. Man I'd love some Xanax right now. But cognitively I know that 6 mg of Suboxone is plenty, and that going up a) probably won't make me feel better and b) is going to get in the way of processing these emotions. 

This is tougher than I thought it would be. She was 97, had dementia, was in a care facility ... this is not a tragedy. But taking care of her has been a huge part of my life these past few years. I need to mourn, and though I can't be completely off MAT I'd rather be slightly under-medicated because I actually do want to feel this shit.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"End of day 13. Two weeks tomorrow. 2 weeks ago it felt like I'd NEVER get to 2 weeks clean. I cried today just thinking.... thinking about the worse days, then thinking about today, and how even with these lingering symptoms I could live feeling like this for 2 more weeks easy. I'm crying like 5xs a day right now its crazy. When does the happy come? Lol I'm still worried I'm going to hit more really bad days. Sleep has been shitty BUT I'm still getting sleep. I think that's really really helped. I dont know i feel like I'm getting off too easy, I mean its fuckin hard af but I definitely went thru way worse coming off pain pills ct back in the day. Anyways, just thought I'd update. Thank you all of course for all ur encouragement and tips and ... just everything. I say it all the time but its fuckin true I COULD NOT have done this without yall. Any tips on getting some energy in me? I'm eating ok, I cant eat much at one time, but I'm getting at least 2 small meals a day. And I technically do exercise while I work, I clean a church daycare/school 7 days a week for bout 2 hours and have been pushing to really work up a sweat n bring up my heart rate the past couple weeks at work. It does feel amazing right after I'm done, I shower as soon as I get home and still feel amazing, but it tapers back off into ""blah"" soon after. I guess I'm wondering when the blah feeling will go away. Ok I'm rambling, have a good night guys, I hv so much love for you all!


Edit 1: 2 weeks today guys!! Wtf I can't believe i made it this far! Nothing new to report really, I'm having a lil worse of a day today but I barely slept last night, my legs were so achy all night so I probably slept maybe 2 1/2 hours total. Nothing I cant handle tho. I'm going to get the b6 and l-tyrosine today for help with my energy levels that are non existant at this point.

Refund Time bupe.me!l KY restarts/new. Just curious as to how long it took to get a refund from Bupe.me within the past month or so? I was a restart with them so I went on and paid $155 just to have to find out after trying to see if I needed to do anything else be able to get my script besides pay the fees and hours later I got a response saying sorry the KY doctor is not taking restarts or new patient and they would avoid my payment. Well I found another doctor that can see me tomorrow but obviously I don't have the money to be able to reserve and pay for my appointment so if you're in Kentucky and are not already a full-time patient you might as well go on somewhere else. And I'm not saying they screwed me out of any money or anything as of yet but I just like to know from others who have experienced this even if you're not from my state.,1,0,0,0,0,0

"Quick.Md vs Bupe.me. I'm creating this post because tomorrow I was due to see my doctor on Quick.Md which I've used for quite a while now to get prescribed Subutex. Anyway, the day before my appointment it gets cancelled due to ""missing paperwork."" Well I inquired which you can only do by email and it's slow and frustrating. So turns out they want me to submit a Urine Drug Screen and they fraudulently have declared that they asked me originally back in January although none of the doctors ever mentioned anything and I cannot find the said email anywhere including my Spam. I'm considering switching over to Bupe.me simply because I'll run out of medication before I can get this sorted. Has anyone tried both of them that could give me some comparison? Was it hard to switch between services? Anyone got any good advice here or experience? My mind is just spinning and my anxiety is running high. It would be nice to talk to others about this.
