"To tell Or not to tell. Do you disclose to your doctors that you are an addict ?  Why ?  Has it ever backfired per se ? Do you think the treatment you received was the same as the non addict ?


  Once I found it necessary (who knows why ?) , but I no longer share that I'm an addict. I take 1mg of subs and don't see any drug interactions that can occur. If by any miniscule chance its a possibility- I assume the risk. I will never disclose to doctors of my prior drug use. My last drink was in 2008,,,,, what good comes out of telling an orthopedic surgeon  I'm an alcoholic ?  None,  ime it affected treatment- to the negative.  
Imo, there's little to no relevance,,, that coupled by the high probability that it will adversely affect treatment- i say Dont Tell.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Update on AL telemedicine. So the lawyer got back to the pharmacist and I thought I would go ahead and let you guys know. 

Right now AL is saying that telemedicine will not work for new patients. If you have already been seeing a telemedicine service then you can continue treatment and have your scripts filled. I went onto QuickMD to see what it says about AL, and it currently says that they are not accepting new patients. 

The other problem that I am currently facing is that they searched her via her DEA number and it does not list the states that she is licensed in. Due to that they are not wanting to fill the script. I'm not sure how to go about this and contacted QuickMD. Thanks for reading this huge rant. It seems like telemedicine is now over in AL, and I don't know what that spells for the future in other states. 

If other places decide to go about it like AL, and if you're considering switching to telemedicine, do it now before it's too late. If you're already an existing patient they won't stop you from getting your scripts filled.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Have you had this issue coming off from SUB?. Do you have problems with your ARMS feeling like (RLS) Restless Leg Syndrome when tapering? That is the only way I can describe the feeling. I have gone from 24mgs to 4mgs in about 2 months. I have been on 4mgs for 3 months now. Every time I try to drop from 4mgs to 3mgs I get that feeling in my arms and it wakes me from my sleep and I cannot go back to sleep unless I take 1mg dose back to 4mgs. It happens about the 18 hour mark after taking 3mgs. So it wakes me up around 1am or 2am in the morning. If I could get past that feeling I know I could do this. I can handle the mental because I now it’s temporary. But, trying to handle that physical withdrawal drives me absolutely insane because I cannot sleep or sit still. That sucks at 2am in the morning. I’m walking around a dark house trying not to wake the family up. I have also tried splitting it up, 2mgs in the morning and 1mg at night and it still does the same thing as asking all 3mgs at once.

"I need recommendations on subs coming off Kadian/Dilaudid. Thanks for reading in advance, I could really use some advice. 

I've been trying really hard to get off fentanyl so I had gotten on something called the safe supply. They subscribe you hydromorphone and doses are crazy and didn't help the fact that I was shooting it. So I recently went to my closest recovery clinic and asked about suboxone.
 I initially wanted 300 mg's of kadian (6 pm) (extended release morphine) so I got that for the first day. I felt okay in the first hour and then felt like shit so I popped a couple dillie 3 mg's (11 pm) to help and then took trazadone (11 pm) and by the time I woke up I felt great. 
The protocol was that I switch onto suboxone gradually taking 2 mg's until I reach 12 mg's. He told me to wait 24 hours after taking the Kadian and 12 hours after dilaudid until I touch the subs. I waited 25 hours before I touched the suboxone and took 6 mgs total until I was shot into insane precipitated withdrawals. I thought I waited long enough but I guess my body was taking longer to clear the morphine out of my system. Now it's been 6 hours and I feel like my symptoms are getting worse. I've got every symptom in the book x 50, and im not sure what to do. I'm not sure if I should stick another 2 mg of suboxone under my tongue or straight up take more dilaudid but I I'm pretty sure the dilaudid won't do shit because the suboxone is blocking those receptors right ? I know taking morphine wouldn't work on my goal of getting clean today but I'm calling my doctor tomorrow to work on the protocol.

Can I use my oxycodone to come off .5mg of Suboxone?. Oxy was prescribed for pain but I developed headaches. I tapered off them but was rx'd suboxone which in retrospect seems dumb as I still have the headaches. Now I need off the bupe. Thoughts?,0,0,0,1,1,0
"Never too late. I've been addicted to opiates since 2007 when OC 80s were prevalent in America. I destroyed many relationships and went to many rehabs where I would inevitably relapse after months clean. I used to be afraid of suboxone because in my mind I wanted to be clean of all opiates and was afraid of suboxone WD.

After over a decade of opiate addiction I finally said to myself that I'm going to try suboxone because I was so sick of having negative money and being sick every day. Inducing subs was a nightmare in itself because of fent being everywhere. I waited 72 hrs after my last fent dose and took 2mg of subs. I went into PWD but I toughed it out and laid in bed for 3 days next to a fan and heater so I never felt too hot or too cold.

I kept taking 2mg sub every 6 hours and eventually felt human again after about 5 days. I adjusted my dose up and down depending how I felt but I'm stable on 6mg a day for the last 9 months. Some morning cam be harder than others but I always feel normal 30 mins after my morning dose.

If you're in the US, suboxone is very easy to get, much easier than it was 5-10 years ago. The pandemic really opened alot of options for addicts with telehealth doctors being able to prescribe suboxone and comfort meds such as gabapentin, clonidine, etc. You can contact a telehealth such as bupe.me and get a script for a months worth of sub in the same day.

I know inducing subs can feel impossible but it's possible if you lower your dose and wait long enough. You can also try the Bernese method by slowly taking subs while using your DOC and slowly increasing the amount of subs you take while lowering the amount of your DOC.

I know being on subs isn't as ideal as being 100% clean, I wanted to be 100% clean so bad but I could never make it stick even when I was 90 days clean from everything after rehab. My quality of life is so much better on subs and for the first time in my life, I feel confident that I won't slip up and relapse on fent which could easily kill me.

I understand subs aren't for everyone and many people still feel cravings while on subs but my cravings have been minimal to almost non existant. I don't know how long I will stay on subs if not forever but I'm happy to be on it right now. My medical covers all my suboxone and is about to cover my monthly sublocade shot which costs over $1000 a month. I've heard tapering is easy on sublocade compared to tapering suboxone.

"Why does my SO lie about his subs?. I've been posting/ commenting here and there under another account until I had to change UNs... here to support my boyfriend. 
I think he's embarrassed of being dependent on something. He's a very successful professional and i think he fears if it ever got out if he is taking them. 
At first I was here so we could try and get him off of subs (his request, I wanted to help) so I came here for advice. He eventually went back to them and lied about it. 
Then he has been lying about how much he's been taking. (He's not taking more than rxed,  just saying he's taking much less than he really is. ) He gets so defensive when I find out something as well that he was lying about. 
Today/ yesterday he blatantly lied about going to another parish, over an hour away to pick up FIVE films for cash price,  said it was his acid meds. I asked why it couldn't be transferred to his pharmacy he and he didn't know. Well now I know why... it was controlled. 
Is embarrassment a real thing with this medicine? I apologize if it's a dumb question. I've never been on anything like Suboxone.

"Day 8 detox. Day 8- So today I walked outside for a bit. I slept 5 1/2 hrs in two shifts, and then naturally for 45min on the couch for a nap this evening!  Even 30min sleep is like a god sent recharge. It's mostly mind games. Anyways...

So day 8, the hardest is still adjusting and dealing with insomnia, as well as off and on upset stomach. Can't eat meat yet, lots of oatmeal, bananas, yougurt, protein bars and vitamins. I went 4 nights of 2-3hrs of sleep. It's a response of fight or flight in early withdrawals, but today I felt a bit better. I do get pretty achey and exhausted doing too much. But I can keep up with some chores. Force myself outside for 15min.

All in all things seem to be getting better on day 8, with lingering symptoms. I def could not work with the meds, sensitive stomach and insomnia though. I'd be pretty sore and miserable on me. 

At this point if I can get the insomnia straight and sleep a full 6-7 hrs a night. I think I could deal and push myself back into jogging and full meals.

"Is it really a ""miracle"" drug?. I see many post that call Suboxone/Subutex a miracle drug. But is it really? People say to me oh I'm so glad you're not using. Um, I'm taking an opioid three times a day. I'm taking an opioid that is 40 times stronger than morphine. Of course I'm okay. I'm still taking drugs. The only real benefit I see in buprenorphine is it is very hard to overdose on it. Other than that I suffer all of the side effects of somebody taking a powerful opioid daily. I see some people claim that they have put their life back together on it. It has completely killed any motivation that I had. I don't want to leave the house. I'm constantly depressed. I have no sex drive. I nod off. I have to take afternoon naps because I'm so fucking tired. I wished I would have researched Suboxone further before I started it. Out of desperation and tired of living on oxycodone I jumped at what I thought would be a better alternative. Now I'm not so sure. Has it kept me from using other opiates? Yes. But now I'm tethered to buprenorphine just like I was tethered to oxycodone. This will probably get downvoted but I had to vent.",0,0,1,0,0,0
What are the rules on picking up suboxone early?. I visit my sub doctor every four weeks exactly and then head straight over to Walgreens to fill my script. Some times I am told I have to wait until the next day to pick it up? My script is written for 28 days. Most times I am able to get my sub the same day as my appointment. But then randomly at other times they will tell me it's too early and I have to wait another day. One pharmacist told me that the law is that you cannot get your sub script early? But then how come normally I can pick up the same day I get prescribed? My boyfriend feels that the pharmacist is the issue in that they have too much left up to their discretion. He thinks I get screwed over because I am too nice and no matter how shitty I feel I put on my public face and dont' make a scene. I'm just sick of having problems at the pharmacy and having o keep going back a million times. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with the pharmacy?

"Precipitated Withdrawals. Howdy, ya'll!  So I have been using dope, far more than I'd like (I recently got back up to 100mg day for a short while), and I want to get myself onto suboxone.  I haven't found a doctor willing to help me, the one doc I found prescribing suboxone wouldn't treat me due to baclofen and clonazepam prescriptions that I genuinely need for symptoms of transverse myelitis, and last time I tried suboxone I also only had 8 pills worth and the person who was supposed to get me more flaked.  It did allow me to get off dope though, and I was clean for over a month but I couldn't find a pain doctor willing to prescribe me opioids and I was tired of having my pain limit my mobility so I started using again.  

I have since gotten 22 more pills of suboxone and I believe a more steady supply in general, the thing is I'm scared as hell of having another precipitated withdrawal which I had the first time.  I was using about 120-150mg a day back then, I waited about 12 hours which had me having notable withdrawal symptoms (I'm a wuss I guess), I took 2mg of suboxone and I got real close to needing to go to the ER.  I thankfully had someone with me who was able to help try to keep me hydrated, but I was sweating so badly and losing consciousness while laying flat, it was insane.  I don't want to experience that again, holy hell.

So I'm aiming to do less than 65mg today, I'm lowering my dope and adding kratom, and I'm wondering how low/long of abstinence you all would feel comfortable going before making the jump.  I was hoping it would be relatively okay to do 1mg to see how I react if I could manage 24 hours of kratom only, but I've also heard a lot of the fentanyl cut dope has people going through PWs like 3 damn days later.  This most certainly has fent in it. 

**TLDR**:  I'm scared to go through PWs again, I have health problems in general wearing me down right now and I don't think my body can really take another beating like that right now, what would you recommend to avoid them?   Can I take kratom leading up to suboxone without getting PWs?  

Also, I wonder if any doctors prescribe morphine or something for a few days before switching their patient to suboxone, then they can avoid this ridiculous shit if it's true how bad the fent reaction is.

The doctor for those states has left and they do not have anyone to fill the spot. They did say they got someone to cover for North Carolina, but that scripts could be over a week late. They stated all of this in their weekly video, so if someone in one of those states didn’t watch that video today, they would have no idea. To add insult to injury, the woman who provides the “secret word” to put on the weekly form made the word for the week “healing” and stated she needed healing more than anyone else right now because she is getting over COVID. Are you kidding me?!? Probably over a thousand people are already going through withdrawal or will be soon because of this organization and she thinks her sickness is more important. I’m sure a countless number of individuals in those states will not be able to find a new provider in time and will potentially relapse. This just shows how little Bupe.Me really cares about their patients or their “cause”.  It’s all a giant scam.

"96 Hours since last 0.5mg dose!!!. So yesterday was pretty uneventful leading up to about mid afternoon. I slowly started to feel worse in terms of body aches and fatigue. I ended up in bed by around dinner time and the few times I got up it was extremely exhausting just to go from my room to the kitchen and back. (1 flight of stairs). The body aches were enough that the Advil and Tylenol didn't take them away but not to the extent I couldn't sleep. I slept through the night and only woke up breifly once.I still didn't have any bad anxiety, RLS, chills, sweating, sneezing or anything else except the aches and fatigue. This morning I had to take 2x 2mg Lopermaid pills to hopefully plug up Niagara Falls that appeared this morning. The aches are better then last night but a bit worse then yesterday morning. Feeling fatigue as well but nothing like last night. To give you an idea, if I was working a desk job I could probably struggle through a day of work as long as my cubicle was close to a washroom. I would say things are going pretty well compared to how bad they could be!

"chronic constipation: any experiences with movantik and/or relistor?. the only post i could find about this on reddit is 3 years old; so thought it'd be good to make a new one:

From what I understand, these meds are ""peripherally acting μ-opioid receptor antagonists"" (one is methyl-naltrexone, the other is a naloxone derivative). they somehow block the effects that opioids have on the GI tract without crossing the blood brain barrier.

I'm curious what people's experiences have been with taking these and/or other meds for chronic constipation due to bupe? there's lots of research on their use for full-agonist opioids, but as we all know, bupe behaves a lot differently!

Also if anyone has info on the availability of generics and/or the co-pay cost with medicaid; please share 🙂

idk if this is the case everywhere, but my state medicaid helpline won't give cost info for meds. the only way to find out is once they're prescribed and u check with the pharmacy.

"My experience for those wanting to start.. I had tried subs off the street before but I was afraid of actually going to a clinic I though it would be a difficult and expensive process, however this is my experience.

Day0: I start calling clinics in my area to make sure they accept my insurance and try to schedule an appointment. It took about 2-3 hours of making calls but I finally found a clinic that would take my insurance and better yet they could see me the next day. I talk to the receptionist on the phone she gives me the rundown and makes me an appointment.

Day1: I wake up at 430 sick the stamp I did at 6pm the day before was pretty weak. I knew it would be shitty to make it to my appointment at 2pm but i took some NyQuil and tried to go back to sleep. I woke up again about an hour before my alarm still not feeling great but I could manage . I get ready for school and head to class. I get out of class and head to my appointment. I check in fill out my paper work and hang out a minute. They call me in for a urine sample which I've never had to do in front of somebody before . I struggled they give you three tries finally i manage and move to the next waiting room. About 5 minutes later I'm called into a room with a nurse she takes my weight and vitals and asks a few questions then dismisses me back to the waiting room. Two minutes later the Dr. Calls me in . I go in she introduced herself took my cows score she could clearly tell I was in moderate withdraw. She asked if I had ever taken subs before and about my past drug habits (oxy for a few years then heroin). I tell her everything being honest. When I used subs on the streets I always kept my doses below 8mg typically 2-4 mg per day . She's surprised to hear this. Writes my script for 7 8mg strips a week and tells me to take what I need but try to keep my dose low. Finally she recommended a pharmacy for me to go to that's close by and accepting . When I go to leave my copay is $0 so that's amazing.

Pharmacy: I walk in having no money I show the tech my script, insurance, and ask what my copay will be . He comes back a few minutes later saying $15 I don't have it so I tell him I'll have to come back . He says that he can give me 1 strip now and fill the rest and I can pay tomorrow, Fucking amazing. I take my 1 strip and dose 4mg and head home. At home I dose 2mg more and call it a night.

Day2: I wake up take the last 2mg of my 1st strip. After my class I head over to the pharmacy again with money for my prescription. I ask them about it everything is ready just pay and sign. Then out the door easy peasy.

Tldr: It was surprisingly easy and I feel relieved I did it. 15$ and a few hours was all it took. Don't be afraid to get started if you want to get on subs.

Used to be stable on 4mg suboxone for frame of reference. But after a bad relapse I went on methadone up to 90mg. I have now made the decision to move back to suboxone, and have tapered down to 35mg methadone.

My plan is to take 72hrs since my last dose, or until withdrawal symptoms are mild. At that point I'm just curious what dose would you guys think would be needed to stabilize? I'm sure it's subjective, and varies from person to person, but I'm just looking for a ballpark for what dose I should expect to need so I'm not so in the dark. Seems no where on Google can really tell me. I read somewhere that 30mg methadone equals around 8mg suboxone. And so after 3 days off 35mg methadone I'm thinking I should stabilize around 8-12mg the first day?

"Has anyone noticed a difference in suboxone potency depending on when you take it?. I've been on it for about 6 years and just recently began noticing the differences in how strongly I feel the effects depending on what time of the day I take it. If I take it very soon after waking up I sometimes will feel like I haven't taken it at all, or if I do feel it it's very slight. But if I wait until I've gotten up and begun moving around and my blood is pumping THEN take it I've noticed I feel the effects a lot better. I'm guessing after waking up your heart rate is lower so the medication isn't being distributed as quickly, whereas taking it after moving around makes sure the medication is getting spread throughout your body more properly. Or maybe after waking up your metabolism isn't as active but it speeds up when you're moving around so the body processes the medication more effectively. I've tried to make sure to take it about an hour or two after I've gotten out of bed and have been doing something for a while and it seems doing it that way helps me feel more satisfied and for much longer. I used to take half a dose in the morning and half in the afternoon because I felt it wearing off but taking the first dose a good while after waking up seems to keep that from happening.",0,1,1,0,0,0

"My experience with the Bernese Method. I have nobody I can talk about this with in real life and so it helps to discuss this with people in similar situations.

I was shooting about a gram a day of decent H for the last year. I tried a CT/Rapid sub taper detox and I was able to stay off opiates for about a month. However, I kept trying to lower my sub dose and I eventually spiraled into a relapse that lasted 3 months.

This is when the bernese method came into play. During my relapse I always made sure I took at least 1mg of sub so it never left my system. About 2 weeks ago I decided I would start to up my sub dose each day and see if I could get off the dope.

Each day I went up .5mg. This was easy until I got to 4mg. At 4mg I would start feeling mild WDs about 2 hours after taking it and would use dope to get out. I kept pushing and by the time I got to 8mg, I was out of dope.

Its been 60 hours since my last shot of heroin and I did not have any major PHYSICAL  withdraw symptoms. However I am an emotional wreck, motivation is low, and I just shot myself in the arm about 15 times with a pellet gun. I have about 6 lead pellets completely lodged in my arm that I have no way of getting out without surgical tools. The fucked up part of it all is that it actually made me feel better. Endorphins I guess.

"Doctor Wants me on Subs: Benzo and Kratom Addict. I'll try to keep this short and sweet because my ADHD usually has me leaving long-winded posts. Soooo, my partner and I are both addicted and dependent on Etizolam and Kratom. We have tried pretty much every RC benzo in the past in the ""honeymoon days"" and we used to abuse Percocet, till I found Kratom. I lost my source for Perc and it was too expensive online, so I fell in love with Kratom. I have tapered off completely before, but probably the longest break was 6-7 days (without benzos). In October '19, I wanted to get off Kratom, used Clonazolam, abused it and didn't stop after I was through the woods of Kratom WD. I had jumped at 8GPD from a 30GPD habit.

Fast forward to now, I am a shell of my former self. I stay up late, I sleep in as long as I can. I'm afraid of everything, can barely leave my house without Kratom + Etizolam dose. I'm malnourished. I don't drink much water. I'm living like an invalid junkie. I was going to full-time school for a specific job, but I had to withdrawal (I can go back when I'm ready--I paid upfront) because it was like 24 credit hours. Also classes were all gonna be in-person, starting at 8:45am, and I've never been a morning person. With my bad memory, anxiety, having to manage addictions secretly while in 8-hr days of class, and not being able to work because the material IS DIFFICULT. Lots of science and learning it way too fast. I was having panic attacks, so I withdrew. I felt better for the first few days...so much stress off my shoulder.

But now I find myself at home, wasting away, maybe able to accomplish 4 tasks per day. I'm so demotivated. I feel worthless and hopeless.

OKAY: so here's my dilemma. Everything I've read about using Suboxone to quit Kratom is that it's outrageous. I've asked several friends who know the drug world and they all say it's a bad idea. And I mostly agree. The doctor wrote me one week of Clonazepam, 1mg, 2x daily. He was gonna give me Xanax but I said I hate intradose withdrawals. And of course he referred me to the MAT program two floors below him. I think they hate Kratom because the docs, FDA, and Big Pharma are losing patients to a natural plant. My partner goes to same doctor and he started Suboxone about 3 weeks ago. He quit Kratom like after 2 days and has no cravings (DUH). But what astounded me the most is he was able to lower his Etizolam from 20mg to 4mg immediately. He started having some tremors at night, and I recognized he was going through benzo WDs from the rapid dosage cut, but the doctors didn't agree. He took a little more Etizolam for a few days and he seems better.

SO this is a long-ass post. I'm sorry. My question is...should I try Suboxone? It has changed him for the better. He doesn't need to dose benzos every 4 hours and he isn't having to time out Kratom and food, or worrying about which strain to take, etc. I'm jealous of that. He smiles now and laughs. He has more energy. He is like a brand-new person. Meanwhile I'm still taking 20G of Kratom a day and at least 18-20mg of Etizolam. Day 2 of Klonopin so I know I will likely be able to lower Etiz as well. My partner had a good argument. He said ""everything you've been doing since you started taking Percocet hasn't worked. things just have gotten worse. Maybe it's time to listen to medical professionals.""

I am SOOOO divided on this. I have an appt next week and have already expressed concerns about moving from Kratom to an actual, super-potent opioid, usually indicated for those with opioid use disorder. But maybe I'm in denial. If someone offered me a pain pill, I would take it in a heartbeat. I also made the mistake of ordering 200 Nucynta from India one night when I was really high on Etizolam and Flubromazolam. Haven't had any of that since January or February. I remember being dope sick in class and it was pretty bad for a few days. It's been over a month since I ordered and not sure it's even shipped... maybe it won't come. I'll be mad, especially because it contained a bunch of Cialis and Viagra (which I DO need). But shit, what if it does come and I have 200 100mg Nucynta pills. For reference, one pill is equal to 20mg of Oxycodone. I don't think I have the willpower to throw them away. And I don't really have any friends in my current city I can sell them to. I could visit back home and probably sell all of them and make a lot more than I paid. 

Thoughts and opinions, please?

TL;DR? Polysubstance addict/abuser who just got prescribed Klonopin to come off Etizolam and is getting referred to the Suboxone maintenance program to kick Kratom. This feels like a lifechanging decision. I'm just not sure if it'll be for the good or the bad... Should I work with the docs and give Suboxone a try, seeing as it's helping my partner so much and I'm sick of how I'm living currently?

"Subutex Doctor Referrals for a move to The Denver Area. SOS!. Good Morning Team,

Happy Friday!

I am in a little bind here…

Long story short, I have been on Subutex for five years and currently taking 8mg’s of Subutex and at a stable dose.

I have called probably over 40 clinics,doctors, pain management centers, you name it and I am having no luck.

I will still have Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois since I will be working from home, just in a different state and the only place that I called that was the closest to helping me out was Magnolia Medical, however they do not take BCBS of Illinois and they can’t even guarantee intake.

Also I have been in Suboxone but I have an allergic reaction on my face, my hands go numb, and I get dizzy when I stand up to where my vision gets blurry. 

That is why I have been on Subutex for the last 5 years and not Suboxone.

My fear is that I will move out there and not have a doctor lined up. It will make me extremely anxious.

I have never dropped dirty in my five years, never missed a doctors appointment, have not had a drink of alcohol since July 11th 2020, so that is my jam that I am currently in.

My current doctor is ready to send a letter to any doctor/clinic/pain management center and send my urine labs.

Any help will be GREATLY appreciated.

Please be my miracle 🙂

1) Does anyone have experience with Lucemyra and would it be ok to just do 1 pill x 3-4 doses tomorrow to avoid her sleeping the whole day? And then taper from that level?


2) I am not sure of why there is a requirement for her to need 7-10 days to start vivitrol if she was on such a low dose? I guess if it was lime a jump from 4 mg that makes sense but wouldn't .125mg be pretty negligible in a few days?

"Pharmacy Rules. My partner and I have both been on Suboxone for 6+ years. We use the same telehealth prescriber. I am looking into switching to Sublocade in the next few weeks because I hate dealing with daily medications and pharmacies. But this isn’t about that. 

My partner and I have the same prescriber, same medication, same pharmacy.

I am self pay and I fill my medication every 28 days without issue. He uses insurance and fills his medication every 30 (or 31) days. Last month he filled his medication on 7/19. He was out so he started his 30 day supply that day. The pharmacy will not fill his medication until tomorrow which they say is day 30. But if you count the 19th as a day then technically today is and he will have to go to work tomorrow morning without medication. I do not understand why they fill mine on the 28th day every single month and they refuse to fill his after 29/30 days depending on how you look at it. Is my math wrong? Should he have medication for tomorrow? Does your pharmacy fill your medication the day you need the medicine or the day prior? He goes to work at 4:30AM so it’s just very frustrating. 

I may be in the wrong here! Just curious how your pharmacy handles it and if you have ever had this issue. I will no longer have to worry about this when I switch to the injection but he will.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Thinking about starting. Okay, so I'll preface this by saying I know my situation isnt going to be as rough as some others I've read here. I'm hoping someone will have some advice for me.

I've been taking opiates for 3 years. Oxy and dilauded, nothing harder than that. My peak was around 50-60 mg oxy a day. Not huge by most standards but enough to where not taking one was causing problems.

I started taking because of a knee injury. The pain was causing me to limp and being as my job keeps me on my feet all day, it was a necessary evil. I've since had a minor lower back injury which is yet another reason to take them to function.

My normal routine is a 7.5 mg at 10, 7.5 at 1/2, 7.5 at 4/5, 7.5 at 8/9, and often times another if needed around 11 before bed. And that's down from taking 10mg at a time before. I tried to go down to 5mg but it just didnt work the same and I found myself taking it every 2 hours vs every 3 or 4.

A friend of mine suggested suboxone. I really just want the pain relief and not the high. When I can get dills ill take them instead, as 6 mg dill typically works for the day. Ultimately I'd like to say fuck it and just take ibuprofen and suck it up.

Now heres my dilemma. I've gone 2 or 3 days without using and I've dealt with WD symptoms. Headaches, yawning, sweats, irritable, pain, and just an underwhelming desire to function day to day. I immediately got back on and just tried to manage the doses better.

So my friend suggested suboxone. Helps some with pain but doesnt give the high (I'm okay with that) and hopefully as a way to taper to nothing.

So if I go this route, what dose would be a good starting point? I've seen 8, I've seen 4, I've seen 2 ... I don't know how to gauge because I know others here have been in far worse straights than myself.

"Will modafinil help with no motivation on subs?. I'm going on two years on subs. These two years were unlike any other time I've been on subs. The slight mood lift and energy I once got from subs have been gone this whole time. I'm having trouble just getting simple stuff around the house done.

"Why do you really want to quit subs?. I’m not judging nor being accusatory but why do you personally truly want to be off of Subs. At one point in time they were a lifesaver to stop the damage and cycle of addiction. Lately I’ve been stabilizing but here were some thoughts that have entered my mind on why I would like to eventually come off of them. 

* The other night I was just feeling “meh”. Not up , not down. I’m not used to not being able to manipulate my body to feel a certain way. Made me feel trapped. Kind of depressed. Then the next morning I woke up and went to work and was glad I was on them and couldn’t use. 

* What if I could just be off of them. Then I wouldn’t need to be on something every day. Then I remembered how I felt the other night and am convinced I would have used “something” to feel better.

* I miss the highs. How do I ever capture that overwhelming feeling of positivity, peace (at that moment) and sociable person. A life without highs? Fuck. 

* How am I supposed to deal with these social events coming up. I don’t know who I am without manipulating my personality before entering these situations. I feel helpless at times not being able to manipulate my feelings to cope with “x” scenario. 

* Where the fuck is my reward after a hard work day 

* I’m just normal on them. I’ve never been normal. How is this a good life to live ? Life seems to mundane. I can’t alter myself. This is strange. 

So these are reasons in my head (fleeting but I’m just being real) of why I can see myself getting off subs. Not to say I would go use again but on subs we are all kind of maxed out on what we can feel. I’m not used to that and haven’t been in over a decade. 

Anyone else help share some reasons why you truly want off of subs. Are all of you just wanting off to be off of taking a substance or can anyone relate to what I’ve felt above?

Switch back to suboxone and have been taking it again since March of last year. 

I have always woke up 30 mins before my alarm goes off and dosing 3/4 and going back to sleep and I would take another 1/4 of a piece right before bed that night. But since I’ve been getting the headaches, I don’t even set my alarm because I know I’m gonna have a headache and waking up is seriously the most dreadful time of day for me. I have been taking my dose right before bed and that’s the only time I take it now. (3/4 or a 8mg strip.) has anyone else experienced this or have any advice for me? Is it due to me swallowing the Naloxone while I’m sleeping? Is it just because I’m doing it before bed? BCs and Advil and everything else doesn’t even touch these headaches. I only get them on my left temple and that’s the only place. Two times they’ve been so bad that I wake up and my left eye is somewhat swollen. 

I would seriously kill myself if I knew I’d get these every day of my life. There’s no way I could deal with these every single day. I don’t wish these headaches on anyone. Thank you for taking the time to read. Hopefully someone can relate and I can get back to everyday life. ",1,1,1,0,0,0

"Eating well during detox seems to make all the difference.. I've had people tell me to be sure and eat well and I kept taking that to mean ""Don't let yourself get malnourished"". It didn't hit me until a while later that that's one of the easiest ways to trigger dopamine in the brain. I'd been eating gas station pizza and occasionally a chicken sandwich or something just to get the bare minimum of nutrition, but today I went and got a decent-sized sub sandwich with high-protein meats and loaded it up with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, spinach, jalapenos, etc. and I swear eating that sandwich seemed to flip a switch in my brain. This is the most normal I've felt since starting detox.

"Anxiety/panic just thinking about when I finish my taper.. I was totally off opioids for almost a year in 2017 but remember that time being extremely difficult. Eventually I relapsed. It was just too hard to try and work daily while being sober. After the relapses, I got on Suboxone but still struggled for a year. I would take my DOC and Suboxone on/off. I was doing this because although Suboxone helped, it didn't give me the surge of motivation/confidence to do work and be social. After a year of lying to the doctor, I became 100% honest with him. After that, I stuck to just Suboxone and learned how to get stuff done without feeling a boost of motivation first. I existed like that for a year and then started tapering 6 months ago. I'm now on 2mg and preparing for 6 months more of tapering to 0mg. 

All the old memories of trying to live 100% sober are coming to the surface. When I read others' stories of getting off Suboxone I get filled with panic. When I'm in bed at night, it's particularly bad. I don't know how I'm going to do this.

"Wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar. I have been on Suboxone now for about 10 years. I was initially started at 21 mg (way too high!!!!) and over the years tapered down.

I got down to 0.75 mg and for *years* could just not taper any lower or I would experience the worst withdrawal symptoms-especially depression.

Anyhow, I had surgery a few months ago and I was required to take antibiotics for a week after. I was also supposed to increase my dosage of suboxone for pain relief.

I found that the combo of the antibiotics and increased sub made me feel so sick and out of it that I actually *decreased* my sub intake-down to 0.125 mg…and I felt *better.* No withdrawals, *nothing.*

I have maintained that dosage of 0.125 mg up until a week ago (I did try increasing my dose to 0.25 mg-0.50 mg, but all it did was make my lethargic and not feel well.

And now we come to a week ago where I forgot to take my dose at all and then decided just to skip it altogether and I’m fine? I am on antidepressants, so maybe they are helping, but I have been on the same antidepressants this entire time and I have *never* been able to titrate so low, much less stop entirely before.

I did experience some very mild w/d symptoms during certain stages but they were totally manageable.

I’ve been dealing with all of this for awhile now and additional problems (especially gastrointestinal) from my bupe products not dissolving/absorbing properly. If this sounds like you, the problem is that your mouth is too acidic!!! I wish I could credit the person who mentioned how bupe needs an alkaline environment to dissolve properly. I read it awhile back and that started my adventure to fix my issue. Anyways, I recently began eating better, less acidic food and drinking more and more water. With this came better absorption and feeling a lot better in general. The final straw was being diagnosed with GERD and being prescribed a PPI. 

I started this now 3 days ago and day 2 I noticed a life changing difference in how my medication dissolved and how I felt. All around I felt like a new person. Tums were also recommended before dosing (prior to using my ppi) to reduce the acidity in the mouth before doing in order to counter the acidic bupe products. Please don’t go out taking a bunch of drugs without talking to your doctor. Don’t go crazy on tums and please try to eat and hydrate better.

"I need help with dose and perhaps cravings.. I have been on Suboxone for a little over a year now currently on 2 maybe 3 mg per day. Lately I have been struggling with the desire for some thing more. With pain being an issue I have been telling myself go to a pill mill, but I know how that ends. I am not sure if what I’m having are just cravings and I need to just tough it out or should I up my dose? Suboxone doctors are not much help they just keep pushing more Suboxone which may be the answer, I dunno. I am coming To you all for some advice on whether or not an increase will suffice. I have found myself late at night looking over pain management clinic’s. My teledoctor prescribes me Suboxone 12mg and my regular doctor prescribes Xanax .5 x2 day as needed. I only actually take like I said 2-3mg of subs and my allotted Xanax due to everyone in my house having COVID, normally it’s just break one in half when I’m freaking out. But truly Covid has affected how the dose of Suboxone works So maybe it’s just that the Covid still affecting things! I increased my dose by .5 mg over the course of the day. The dose did not hold at all! Now that I am about over the Covid I am back to my normal dose But the desire/craving started prior to this Covid.

"Need community support.. Never said any of this out loud, not to anyone other than my husband or a past therapist, so bare with me. My issue started in 2012. Mom passed away when I was a teenager and my alcoholic father was soon diagnosed with cancer as well. My boyfriend at the time gave me some Vicodin to help ease the pain and I regrettably took them. Boyfriend was already hooked and begged me for weeks to get a Suboxone script for him since he couldn’t or wouldn’t.. That was my second mistake. I remember I had to lie to the doc, stating I was taking tons of Oxy so I could get a script since what I actually took was not nearly enough to warrant 8mg Suboxone films. That was 10 years ago, and I’ve been tapered down to 8 Sub films per month @ 2mg each.

I finally cut the cord fully from Suboxone last night (Saturday 4/23@955p CST). So I'm sitting here with a full 24hrs plus without under my belt with little ill effects happening. Granted being on this medication for almost a decade and have given tapering and just cutting it out at least half a dozen times I know the worst days are ahead. I just said f' it and jumped right off at 8mg or my last dose was 8mg I should say. I have no reserves and the only light at the end of the tunnel is I have two refills on my pharmacy tab with the next order due 5/4, which by then if I stay the course will be Day #11 without and all the awful physical will be out of me.

"QuickMD vs Current provider. Hi, I have been seeing a doctor in my area for nearly a year. She was the only provider I found nearby that does MAT. they make me come in to the office every month, which is $160 a visit. and I pay for films which are not covered by my insurance, so that adds up to about $310/mo. 
I have a relative who I told to try quickMD after seeing it mentioned here, they needed to get on MAT asap and didn't have a current provider and they said it was good and I should do it, and It was $90 or something for the visit and I wouldn't have to drive to the office every month. my question is, would it be worth it to try quickmd instead of my current provider? it's annoying to me that at my doctor they make me come in every month just to say hello and hand me a script, considering I haven't failed a drug test in nearly a year, and they only piss test me every 3 months anyways. I feel like they make me come in every month just so they can charge me.. it's really inconvenient with my work schedule and probably looks super weird to my coworkers that I go to a doctor once a month as I'm 27... im worried about the whole online visit thing not working out, then me not having anywhere reliable to turn for my medication... any advice  thanks",1,0,0,0,0,0

"One month on subs, questions about relapse. Hey guys so I started on subs about a month ago after about a year and a half of opiate use that started with 15mg oxys and ended up with 14-20 bags a day of what I’m pretty sure was fentanyl or a fent analog, it was defiantly much stronger then normal heroin and I snorted never shot.  This stuff was so strong that I actually had to wait 55 hours until I was sick enough to induce subs and even then I think I was only about a 10 to 12 max on the COWS scale.  I started on 16mg for the first couple days then dropped to 12 and then 8 and I’m fine on 8 most days but some days I’ll still take 12 but I feel like I could be fine on even less then 8 sometimes however I do get some cravings sometimes when I go down to 8.  The next part I probably shouldn’t be considering and maybe I’m just looking to be talked out of it but I’m wondering what the consequences of one days of use would look like.  At this point I haven’t taken a sub in 24 hours and feel fine what would happen if I used 3-5 bags once today and that was it?  Even if I did get somewhat high I would then have to wait until I was in mild to moderate withdrawal after using the dope to be able to successfully get back on the subs right ?  That would happen after using a short acting opiate even just once right? Would it likely take almost 55 hours again for that to happen?  I’ve heard it’s harder to get back on subs everytime after a relapse and I know it’s a bad idea and I’m probably just gonna force myself to take a sub soon so I’ll stop thinking about it but I’m curious if anyone has experience getting high just once while on suboxonetreatment, esp if it’s a short acting opiate with a long half life like fent.

"*Question about withdrawal* I did a jump from 12mg a day sorry long read. I need to explain my situation before I can ask my question. I follow the thomas recipe for the most part but this time i tried using kratom and tianeptine during the first few days. I went through the tia quite fast given it was my first time. 10 grams in about 7 days. It almost totally masked my withdrawal when taken with kratom. I ran out and refuse to get more, i heard tia is nasty stuff plus as a marathon trail runner i did not like how the tia would lower my bp and give me vasoconstriction. Ive gone through 3 opms shots plus 125 grams of kratom in the last 2 days. And that would only alleviate my symptoms not get me high. I cannot afford this habit and I dont want to be addicted to kratom again. I functioned fine on it but taking 45-50gs a day costs a lot. So now im sticking with eti and weed. Since stopping the tia my symptoms got worse and i havent had kratom for 6 hours and symptoms are starting to progress. Heres my question. Did all the tia and kratom only prolong my sub withdrawal?

Just when i thought there was no hope in finding a doctor who can prescribe suboxone, let alone accepting new patients, i find QUICKMD...at first i was skeptical on wether or not it was legit, i thought to myself...there's no way a doctor will prescribe me Suboxone ONLINE...but i spent all day yesterday searching for doctors in my area who were capable of giving me what i need and i had very LITTLE LUCK...so i decided to start researching on the REVIEWS pertaining to Online Doctors and Telehealth methods and Found a few that looked promising...QuickMD, bicycle health, workithealth, lucidlane and a few others...but After researching and comparing the ones i found...I started noticing that QuickMD had the best reviews and had the Cheapest Prices...So i took a leap of faith and made the appointment! It cost $99 for the initial appointment, of course i had fears playing out in my head like, what if this is a scam, what if i lose my money...yada yada yada...But i decided FUCK IT, i want and need the help, whats the worst that can happen...I have been spending SO MUCH MONEY on the OxyCodone 30's i been doing so this $99 aint shit compared to what i been blowing on my addiction! So i made the appointment, and withing 24 hours i was speaking to a doctor VIA video appointment! I was so amazed at how quick, and EASY it was...She was non-judgemental....She was helpful, she gave me hope! I couldn't believe it! Not only did she Prescribe me Suboxone but she also gave me other meds to help with the initial withdrawal before taking the strips and to help me sleep! I was literally IN TEARS...i never imagined that i could find help so easily and quickly, and to make things better...I was offered free help thru their program, which is a counseling type of thing that is online, where you basically complete these, modules, i believe she called them where you are actually given $5 dollar gift certificates for each and every module you complete. There were NO HIDDEN FEES...NOTHING...I simply paid the $99 for the appointment, and at the pharmacy every single medication was FREE due to the fact i have IEHP i live in california so i have Medi-Cal, and they covered Everything.

SO IF YOUR LIKE ME, and you WANT THE HELP, and you need it ASAP...NO hassle, No hidden fees, NO JUDGEMENT....I recommend QUICKMD....I had an appointment with the doctor SUSAN KOO...She was an angel...And a true blessing!

"On the fence. Hi guys, I haven’t been a part of this sub for him for very long but have been using for the majority of my life. 

Right now I am in a position where I want to quit using again (IV heroin and meth)but I’m unsure which route to go. 

I tried Suboxone maintenance years ago and it didn’t go very well but I wasn’t committed at all. I don’t know if I should try that again or if I should do a quick, six-day sub taper and then get on naltrexone as soon as it safe for me to do so. 

I would do the second option without hesitation if I wasn’t scared that I would use in between the Suboxone and naltrexone, fucking everything up. 

I guess what I would like to know is: Is sub maintenance worth it?? To the people who have been on Suboxone maintenance and either quit that successfully or are still on maintenance, does your quality of life improve that much? Would you do it differently if you had the chance? And most importantly, what side effects did you get from the Suboxone? Weight gain, sweats, insomnia, etc. 

I’m scared to be on Suboxone maintenance because I want to feel and experience everything fully and I don’t think that will happen on Suboxone. Songs giving me chills, tearing up during movies…. That type of thing. Did sub mess with any of that for anyone??

"Six Months and I'm Close to the Edge and Ready to Jump. Hi folks,

At the tail end of last year, I politely asked my Doctor how long I had been prescribed my daily dose of 16mg of Subutex. Before even asking the question, I had it in my head that I had only been on the medication for two years at the VERY most. When he took a pause before informing me that I had been on Subutex for 4 and a half years, I nearly fell out of my chair! Honestly.. I couldn't believe it... Hearing that though, was the words that I REALLY needed to really get my shit together and begin tapering.

Since December, I've managed to reduce my daily dosage down from 16mg down to where I stand today at 0.1mg. This subreddit has been an absolute blessing. Without it, I'd have had zero clue on how best to taper, comfort meds, volumetric dosaging etc.

The question I have right now is regarding that final dosage before jumping all together. At what dose do you recommend that I jump? There seems to be an awful lot of people that jump at around 100mg. That being said, since I have the luxury of being able to jump at doses as low as 5mg thanks to volumetric dosing, at what dose would you recommended? My original plan was to jump at 50mg.

"Those with Lucemyra experience, I have a few questions... Hey everyone.. 

So I made a post yesterday about my taper im doing and how now that im under 2mg (1.5mg currently), Im starting to feel the effects and although its mild, its noticeable and uncomfortable. 

I neglected to mention that I actually have 2 full bottles of Lucemyra that were prescribed to me 2 years ago to get off subs, but I never ended up doing it. The bottle says it ""expired"" on 3/2021, but we all know that's likely not going to effect its potency that much after only a year.

My question to those with experience with it is did you use it during your taper to just alleviate symptoms, but continued to taper? or did you just jump off subs completely and start the Lucemyra? I got alot of good info from /u/samlindsssay (thanks again!) and she jumped off subs at 2mg and onto Luce and said it was almost completely pain free!

What is everyones experience with it? and how did you dose? did you quit your taper or continue?

"Questions regarding tapering,WD’s,comfort meds, etc. Before telling me I need to speak to a doctor instead of randoms on the internet, or just stay on it, I should make it clear that I ran out of insurance a while ago. I can’t give a TL;DR but the questions are at the bottom. 

I’ve been on subs since the beginning of this year, I was on 8mg for ~3 months or so, then I started my tapering process around April, which was nothing strict, or constant, I just never went back up and stayed on a dose till I felt okay.

8 to 2mg by 1mg increments... now I’m at 1mg per day.. 0.5mg morning and 0.5mg at night. From 8 to 2mg I felt nothing physical, very slightly mental. Now that I’m at 1mg for 1 week my energy is significantly reduced, muscle pains are strong, but that’s about it.

I have enough left to stay on 1mg for 1 more week, 0.5 for 2 weeks, 0.25 for 2 weeks... and I doubt I can go any lower with that considering I have 8mg strips, but I’ll have a few mg left over just in case I need to extend those weeks.

I’m extremely scared of my energy being non-existent when I get off completely, since taking subs I really feel like it increases my energy a lot. 

What meds can I take to help with withdrawal that don’t need prescription? (Stomach pains, muscle pains, etc)

Has anyone done a tapering process this slow that could tell me what I could be expecting?

"Day 15 opiate free after 4 years. Hello everyone,

So I have been using suboxone for the past 4 years except for many relapses on heroin\fentanyl. The suboxone seemed to enable my problematic IV opiate use. Got stuck in a cycle of 3 months on subs, save money, then blast through it on dope in 1-2 weeks. Then suffer 2-3 days, get back on subs, and repeat. I got arrested 2\7 after a 4 day relapse for nodding off at a stop light. I was taking 8mg\day before the 4 day relapse. Was forced to detox in jail. Fuuuuuuuuck it sucked. 23hr lockdown too... But anyways, I made bail after 13 days and am feeling incredible. My testosterone has sky rocketed, my thoughts are so clear, and my confidence is drastically higher. Because it feels so good, I am now committed to never ever touching any opiate again, no matter what.

I have only slept 8 hrs since 2/7. This is the only symptom that is still bothering me. I still get goosebumps, sneeze 30-50x a day, and have mild diarrhea, but I can handle all that just fine.

Any experience for expectations on when I will be able to sleep? I just checked into a rehab with the hopes that I can get my pending felonies reduced, so marijuana is unfortunately not an option rn. I might ask the Dr for some seroquel or clonidine today, but would prefer to toughen it out so that I'm not dependent on shit.

"Acute and Chronic Pain Management. Hello Folks,

I'll try and make this as brief as possible.

I am on 8mg of Subutex daily, I've tapered off once and been ""forced"" off twice due to major surgeries (that's also how I quit smoking).

I was on it last December when I shattered my upper left distal humerus (you should see the 3D CT scan I have of it). I have very little memory of the next 32 hours as the hospital couldn't control my pain, due to the buprenorphine.

I got off it over a week as I was on IV morphine, and then five days later (the break happened 23rd December 2018 at about 10 pm - perfect timing) had a planned 2 hour, ended up being six-hour, surgery to repair it. I was sent home and was kept on liquid morphine 10mg/5ml for a few weeks, then DHC, then codeine then off.

I started having seizures again, and due to this along with two major bowel surgeries in a year and the arm led me to resign from work to take enough time off to recover. This was July 2019.

I have Crohn's Disease (one of the two inflammatory bowel diseases) which was quiescent during a colonoscopy in March but started to flare back up again three weeks ago. After several foul up's with my GP prescribing the incorrect steroids (I can't take corticosteroids as they cause psychosis -- even being on them for three days this time around led to some rather wild behaviour) I still cannot get sufficient pain relief.

They scripted me 50x 400mcg Temgesic bupe PCA on top of my regular 8mg. This did, to be frank, fuck all.

They wouldn't give me morphine or \*codone due to the quantity required to kick the bupe out could cause respiratory distress or carry an extreme risk of triggering another seizure. I've had 800mg of codeine in 24 hours trigger one. 

So.... what the hell do other people do? I'm in the UK so alprazolam isn't an option. My GP is well aware I am a polyaddict so anything higher than 2mg diazepam is out of the question as are sedative-hypnotics such as z-drugs.

I could go to A&E (ER) wait 12 hours and be sent home. The pain is extreme when acute, but it's due to short term inflammation and not worth wasting a hospital bed on. That and I've spent more than three months on a hospital ward over the past two years.

"Switching from methadone to subs. So like the post says. I am switching from dobe to subs. My last dose of methadone was on saturday. It is now monday and tomorrow I will be switching to subs.

I dropped down to 30mgs and the most I was at was 40mgs of dones. And I have only been on it for about 2 months (little less). 

I have a small frame and a high matoblism. Also, I have switched from dones to subs before, but I dont recall what my dose of done was before making the switch the first time. All I remember is that is was around the same (20mgs, maybe 30mgs). I also remember not being in complete withdrawls the first time and lying to the doc about how severe my symptoms were (I wanted to make sure I was going to get enough subs).

Anyways, I am starting to feel crappy. Been taking kratom but its not helping. Also, its hot as balls and my apartment loss ac. So its even worse and making me feel worse.

But I have a couple of vicodin 500 I was thinking about taking. Also, i have a half of a suboxone pill I was thinking about taking maybe later tonight or early this morning. Just to see if I am going to be ok or perhaps get the PW's over with earlier since I have to work tomorrow. 

You think I will be ok taking the vics now, and taking subs about 18 hours later? Or do you think I should try taking the half of sub I have later on tonight?

"Suboxone for 1.5 years and feel like life is falling apart. I have been on suboxone maintenance for 1.5 years. My psychiatrist assured me this would be good for me. I was all the way up at 16mg. I was the one who decided to taper down about 6 months ago and I am down to 8mg (against the advice of my psych). I have no libido anymore, insomnia every night, get emotional every day, horrible anxiety. The psych blames this on my ADHD medication and lowering of suboxone dose. I recently had to get on medication for the anxiety it was so bad.

Point is, is this normal to be on this much suboxone for this long, and for a psychiatrist to recommend staying on and even increasing the dose (to 10mg)? I am a professional with a lot going on in my life, so I obviously cannot be on this thing forever. I almost feel like this is malpractice at this point.

"What is the best dose to be on, for the LONG TERM, for someone who has been clean for a long time?. **The reason I'm asking:**

I've been on **16 mg** for a over a year. I started my taper, but had difficulties at 3mg. Went one step back up to **4 mg** and that's where I'm at now.

I have much less side effects now. I feel more clear-headed and less 'fake' with people; my social interactions feel more genuine. So I'm fairly happy with this dose.

I am unsure if I want get off this drug at all at this moment. I might stay on it for years or for life.

**Concerns:**

I'm concerned about inter-dose symptoms. I feel a slight boost in my mood that allows me to work better after each dose. This fades after about 5 hours. I believe it wears off quicker at the lower dosages. I dose twice a day now (2x2mg). I go the the gym at the same time every day, and take my second dose exactly before that, so I can use that boost for the work-out.

This does mean my life is fairly centered around the Suboxone dosing. The monthly injections are not available in my country. There are transdermal patches used for pain management. I'm considering asking my doctor for those, as to have a more stable level of buprenorphine in me - this would probably get rid of the ups and downs. But that's a different discussion!

I am concerned that this effect gets worse with lower dosage such as 3, 2 or 1 mg/day. Any comments on this are welcome as well.

"Methadone to Suboxone: my experience. I was in Methadone maintenance treatment for 15 years. Opiates/heroin for 10-15 years before that. I built a wonderful life while in treatment.  Ive had the same good job for almost 10 years, I own my home, and have great friends and family. 

Well, I decided to come off it and try my life with absolutely nothing. Biggest mistake ever. My brain came at me HARD. The last few months,  every single day was agony. I also have mental issues and was able to eventually get off those meds and just control it with therapy while on Methadone.  The Methadone truly helped those issues. Now they were loose again and raising hell. 

So, I THOUGHT I had it all under control. I THOUGHT since I had did so good for so long, that I would be fine. I THOUGHT if I did it right and came off very slow I would be fine. I hadn't even thought about drugs for years. 

And then reality hit me hard. Whatever is wrong with my brain that made me an addict did not go away. Doing everything ""right"" will not cure me. It was pure hell to have these cravings back in my life after all these years. It was pure hell to suffer withdrawal symptoms again. It was pure hell to have that addict thinking again, not sleeping, obsessive thoughts, selfishness, all that. The medicine was what allowed me to have a normal life and I was spiraling without it. I've been in many many different treatments over my life, and I used the tools from all these to try and get through this. They helped some, but none of those ever kept me clean before, either. 

Why did I do this to myself? We are conditioned to believe that absolutely ""clean"" is best. Thats not always the case. I guess I wanted to ""prove"" something. All I did was prove to myself why I got in treatment in the first place. I am an addict. I need medication.  Possibly for the rest of my life. I would never expect a diabetic to not take meds and just deal with it with only lifestyle changes. Even though it CAN be done,  it's just not viable for a huge percentage of patients. Including me. 

So, I got on Suboxone and I'm back. My family is so happy. My therapist is happy. And I'm happy. Maybe someday I'll be able to go completely med free. But if not, I'm ok with it. I DO beat myself up a little, in my mind,  for not being able to successfully come off meds, but I'm working through that with my therapist.

Bouts of realllllllly bad depression, even though I know I should be happy. The only thing I seem to ""feel"" is numb, and in a brain fog that makes me even more anxious. 

So about 4or5 days ago I cut my dose down from 12-16mg too 4-6mg.

"Tell Your Evil/Corrupt Suboxone Doctor Story. First post in this forum, and I'd like to begin by venting: there are apparently A LOT of corrupt/greedy/straight up evil doctors that take advantage of people with opioid addictions in the prescribing of Suboxone. 

I'll start: 

My first sub doctor was partnered with a therapist who was eventually convicted of sexual assaulting several of his patients as well as trading prescriptions/lying to the courts about those patients under supervised treatment in exchange for sexual favors. 

As far as the sub doctor, the day that I told him I no longer wanted to take subs and was willing to suffer through the withdrawal to get off of them, he proudly presented me to the aforementioned therapist saying, ""We got another one that's ready to get clean!"" The therapist scoffed, responding, ""Well now I can't make any more money off of you."" 

The doctor was later arrested by the Feds, and plead guilty to ""...Prescribing high dosages and large quantities of controlled substances, early refills for controlled substances, and continued to prescribe to patients even though he knew they tested negatively for those substances. He also prescribed in exchange for sexually graphic photos and videos; he also prescribed controlled substances not typically associated with psychiatric complaints, and prescribed dangerous combinations of controlled substances.""

My second suboxone doctor ran what I can only describe as a prescription whore house. He would show up in the waiting room absolutely shit hammered drunk, telling the same disjointed, ridiculous story about opiate addiction again, and again, and again, often times forcing people who had made appointments at specific times to be late by up to an hour. As far as who actually ""counseled"" me,  I never once saw the same person twice; it was a rotating menagerie of various medical professionals who all claimed that any and all insurance companies ""mandated"" the prescribing of Zubsolv, yet the sessions were in no way coverable by insurance (so they said).  The office, btw, was composed of three rooms from an old house in which there were several large tables with the aforementioned medical folks sitting around them. The sessions were conducted in direct earshot of everyone in the room. Privacy did not exist.

from what I’ve researched on past BL posts regarding mixing Klonopin and subs (or just benzos and subs in general)
that it’s dangerous and deadly if you DONT have a tolerance to both.
However, if you have a tolerance to one or the other, then it’s safe provided you don’t go to crazy with your dosing. 
That’s from what I’ve read before.

I have no tolerance to benzos , but a huge tolerance to subs. And took the4mg sub 7 hours after 2mg total of Klonopin

"Could use some tapering advice. hi all. been on 8mg subutex (buprenorphine only) for a year now. the last month i have been extremely inconsistent in my doses (skipping a day, taking half, etc), as i am about to go to France for 7 weeks and was trying to lower my doses. i have probably around 45 subs and one more dr visit right before i go so 30 more pills. i really wish i could be completely off them before i go (Sep 20th) but after reading for awhile i’m learning that a lot of people taper over the course of months/years. i have quite a few gabapentin 400mg pills (a big ass bottle of them) and i have access to THC wax. 

Basically, i am looking for some advice on how i can taper the fastest. i’ll be with my GF in france and she knows that i’m coming off them/trying to but i don’t want it to be a miserable time. if i need to take them while i’m in France that’s okay too, but really i wanted to be completely done. i work so i can’t just sit around sick.

"Been off subs a month, went to doctor for help finishing getting off adderall..huge shock when she told me she thinks I was making a mistake and drug tested me. So this just happened and I am still processing it. 

I got off all my meds, except still on 10mg adderall (original dose was 60mg). I’m nervous about getting off adderall but I can’t tolerate it any more. I told her this, this is what the appointment is about. And rechecking my thyroid because I was on 200mcg and can’t tolerate even 1/2 that, so I stopped it too..

So when I got there, I had taken the adderall about an hour before and I was excited I guess, talking fast, trying to explain why I had going on, I was wanting a referral to a psychiatrist for NAD+ or anything that would help me not go through intense withdrawals..

Her response was to drug test me because she thought I was on drugs trying to get more out of her I guess? I have no idea..she also told me she think I made mistake coming off subs and tried to send me to addiction treatment. So…🤨



I told her I’ve taken CBD, so if I fail for that fuck it. 

I told her I understand that she probably has people trying to pull the wool over her eyes, and I don’t blame her for being cautious, but tbh it hurt my feelings… 

I knew I was ready to cry but I didn’t know if it was because I was upset or happy. 

I think it was both honestly. I felt a lack of support, but also, enormous gratitude because apparently she never seen anything like this so apparently I am killing it like you guys tell me, and I love y’all!

"How I avoided the jump with a water taper. Background-abused many things for about 7 years. Dope, oxys, everything. Took methadone for several years later,  before taking suboxone for almost 5. I got on suboxone as a short term solution which turned into several years of trying to detox. I probably tried to go cold turkey from a low dose (1mg) a few times without success. I had a hard time functioning while tapering at such a low dose. It’s upsetting they don’t make doses smaller than 2mg in the states. Made it very challenging. I work full time and have bills to pay. Taking a month off was never an option. I had amazing success after doing a water taper. I took a glass bottle with a dropper, and put four 2mg strips into it. I then measured out 16 droppers full of mouthwash and mixed it all in the bottle. I knew one dropped equaled half a mg. The alcohol in the mouthwash I believed helped me absorb the sub, making me feel better quickly before considering more. Once that was down I put less sub in the solution. After a month I took a week off work. I broke one 2mg down into 20 droppers worth and only took some if I needed to. A week later I was done with everyday doses. I took a few more .1 doses on random nights I needed good rest for work. I skipped my next doctors appointment so I didn’t refill but kept them in the loop. Once I finished the last bottle I was done. It’s been 8 months. Took me two months to regulate my sleeping pattern. My stomach is still a bit off from over ten years of abuse, but I’m done. Like many of you I did tons and tons of internet searching, hoping to find something that made it easier. Tried Kratom, smoked tons of green. Nothing worked like the water taper. It helped me slowly come down without heavy withdrawal. I never thought I would  be able to get off it, but I am. This worked for me. Hopefully it works for someone else. I hope my story can give someone hope so they can spend their days not knowing how many subs you have to make it through the week, or the month. To not wake up and think of it, or lay in bed thinking a small dose will help you rest better. It caused me to feel insane, but that’s addiction. All of you be strong out there.

He’s got a disc out of place that presses on his sciatic nerve. The first time he started on suboxone treatment and did that for about a 8 months (started tapering at 6). The second relapse he just stopped cold turkey and went through the withdrawals. After the 3rd relapse he tried to do it cold turkey but we had a newborn and it wasn’t doable so I suggested suboxone again. This was about 2 years ago. In August/September of last year he started trying to taper off again and got down to 1.25 strips from 2 strips. He was fine, but then randomly after a month of this he started having withdrawals. His doctor suggested he move back up to 1.5 he did that for about 2 months and then boom, withdrawals out of no where. He ended up going back onto 2 strips and was fine until the end of June.

"Suboxone Euphoria. I've just been prescribed Suboxone for help kicking Kratom and Tianeptine - the kratom I was buying was in the form of a chocolate bar which claimed to have 115mg mitragynine per bar & my standard dose was about 2 bars.

I was also using about 300mg of tianeptine sulfate (which is supposedly a longer acting version of the sodium formulation that most people are familiar with, and have read that recreational doses would equate to about 1/3 the same dose of tianeptine sodium - I'm not sure how true any of that is.)

I tended to alternate between the two, taking a dose of one or the other, every other day for a few months. Prior to that I had still been using them, but much less.

Upon my first 2mg dose of the Suboxone tabs, I've been feeling significantly more euphoria than I had been getting from either of the other opioids I'm used to. Is this normal? Without it, I was feeling shaky and extremely anxious + depressed.

"False negative for naloxone?. Hello, so at my last appt my doctor informed me that I tested negative for NALOXONE two months in a row. It’s a saliva test. I’ve never had this happen before. I have been taking my Suboxone as prescribed for years with absolutely zero issue, now all of a sudden I’m getting a false negative on naloxone. She definitely implied she didn’t believe me even though I did test positive for bupe and have never failed any of my drug tests. 

I won’t find out til my next appt whether I passed the most recent saliva test or if I failed due to a false negative. I take my meds in the AM and the appt was in the evening.

"My doctor fucked up. I have alcohol use disorder. I've been in recovery and back into relapse about 30ish times. Sometimes it sticks, sometimes it don't lol (clean right now for 2.5 months- my second longest clean streak!).

I see an NP for MAT. I receive Vivitrol injections once a month to help curb alcohol cravings, in addition to other forms of MAT for alcohol use disorder. I also understand that Vivitrol is commonly used for *opioid use disorder*, but fortunately I don't have that. The last time I used opioids was when I got my wisdom teeth out like 5 years ago, and I used them for recreation a few times as a teenager.

This brings me to today, when I hopped on my online patient portal. I noticed that in my medical history, among my other diagnoses, it said ""Opioid Use Disorder - In Remission"". My NP recorded this as a diagnosis on the last date of my Vivitrol injection.

I know this is a mistake - when I became a new patient we went over my history and I was honest. I also get drug tested about 2x/month and they've all been negative for any drug. I figured that my doctor probably just accidentally selected ""Opioid Use Disorder"" when recording that I got a Vivitrol shot because most people get one for that.

But then under notes it said that she prescribed me Suboxone, along with instructions for taking it. I called my pharmacy and they said they never got it, but they do have a Narcan prescription for me. I don't know why she would even prescribe me subs anyways since I'm on Vivitrol.

**How would a diagnosis for opioid use disorder plus a recorded subs prescription affect my chances of ever being prescribed opioids in the future?** I've never once asked a doctor to prescribe me opioids, I'm more thinking like, what if I break my leg or develop some sort of chronic pain? I assume I would be able to explain taking Vivitrol for alcohol, but certainly not that my doctor fucked up a diagnosis. As I'm sure many of you know, addicts aren't considered the most trustworthy people by doctors - try getting a prescription for your crippling anxiety when you've been diagnosed with AUD.

I guess the upside of this is that I have a Narcan prescription now, which is always great to keep around. I'm going to call my doctor when they open tomorrow to see if she can fix this. Any info or personal experience is appreciated.

ETA: I've been thinking about this all day and it just hit me how dangerous this could be if the pharmacy had actually received the prescription from my NP. What if I wasn't knowledgeable about this interaction, picked up the subs when they were filled, and tried to get high on them? Being on Vivitrol, that could have killed me. And before you say that no one could be that stupid, I guarantee you they can. I've gotten a Vivitrol injection from many different providers and they don't always tell you all the risks or give you the medical alert bracelet/info sheet that they're supposed to.

"Day 17 from 0.5mg Jump (Things got interesting). Well, let me start off by saying that the combo I had going of Clonodine, Clonazepam and Lyrica was doing an amazing job for me. So well that on Day 15, the first day without, that evening was a complete disaster! As a male it's hard to admit this, but I was a fucking mess. My moods after my Vyvanse wore off took a dive into the ditch. I was probably crying pretty hard on and off for an hour about how terrible my life is. Like I was so down it was almost suicidal territory. I was then so angry I couldn't do anything to escape my head like I had done for the past 14 days with those meds, that I was literally punching walls. I don't know how but even after being told on here by others, I didn't expect how I would react to having so many downers in my system to suddenly none. It was like how bad things would get when I was in active addiction and was sick and wanted so badly to just use opiates. I felt the same sort of desperation for the meds I had just stopped. I don't regret using them for 2 weeks but I think maybe a fast 1 week additional taper off them may have helped. Yesterday night started to turn but I talked myself out of it and just stirred in bed most the evening. The first two nights without the meds have given me very little sleep. I guess I should have expected that too but since I was actually sleeping better for the 2 weeks then I was on Suboxone, I easily forgot what withdrawal really is lol. I also stopped the Lopermaid on Day 14 as well so to say things have been ""running"" is an understatement. Also, the body aches picked up without the meds but Advil is still taking most them away. So besides the sleep and digestive issues which are hallmarks of this process I guess things could be much worse. Like we all know, this now seems like it's mostly a mental game. I've been struggling with depression before going off Suboxone so I won't be surprised now if it continues while my brain heals and/or medication for that gets adjusted. Right now I feel worse then when I was on Suboxone, but I know the only thing needed right now is time. Lots of fucking time. I'll be honest as well, the last two nights if the opportunity to use was presented in would have taken it. So for anyone reading this, just be careful getting off Suboxone.

"Confused about Extended Withdrawal of Suboxone but Short Blocking Period of Other Opiates. The lengthy withdrawal of suboxone is pretty well-discussed across this form and other places on the internet. What I don't understand is if Suboxone has such a long withdrawal period due to its high half-life, why are people able to use illicit opiates (oxy, heroin, etc) only 24-72 hours after their last dose?  

From what I can tell, its the bupe (not naloxone) that occupies the opioid receptors in your brain which block other opiates (oxy, heroin, etc) from having any euphoric effect if you try to use them on suboxone. Thus, as you're coming off suboxone, your opiate receptors will slowly have less and less of the drug in place to block opiates (which starts to cause withdrawal symptoms). Does this mean one could use an illicit opioid as soon as the suboxone withdrawal period starts to kick in to full effect? I assume this would provide temporary relief from withdrawal symptoms but only for a few hours or so (as oxy / heroin have much shorter half lives than subs) and then the regular suboxone withdrawal would resume once the illicit opiate wore off? Would there be any precipitated withdrawal if somebody then went back on suboxone after doing this?  

I've read some about people going back and forth between their sub treatment and using oxy / heroin and just wondering how this plays out. If you're on sub treatment and slip up and use oxy / heroin, can you then resume your regular suboxone treatment? Or will that throw you into precipitated withdrawal?

I only ask because every mention I have found of fake Subutex on Reddit has been met with skepticism so naturally I am skeptical. But someone from my circle down there has supposedly died from one of these now.

Has the black market really started pressing Subutex?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Going through W/D tomorrow, any advices?. I've been using Sub for 4 years now, (intranasally) and I got rid of them once and for all. I got enough for today though.

Anyone else did this? I know it's really stupid, but the effect of sublingually was way too much overwhelming, even at extreme low dose. I find that when you snort them, you get a cleaner effect, less nausea and way less fatigue.

I've reduced from 8 mg / day to 1 mg / day, in the span of 4 years.

I barely take 0.25 mg every 3-4 hours / day.

But... Every morning I'm in ""low to moderate withdrawals"", until I take my first dose.

I'm also on Vyvanse, which helps tremendously for my hypersensitivity, I'm more focused on that, more energy and will-power. I've been taking Vyvanse for 2 years now.

"Is jumping from 2mg intranasal dose a bad idea?. Hi guys, 

I've been on sub for a year, tapered down to as low as 250ug (1/32 of a tab) sublingual, but unfortunately I got hooked on snorting instead because it was a great idea at first as I could go super low (like less than 100ug!!!) But I had a hard time not chasing a high once in a while, which led me to up my doses (+4mg, not every day though!) 

I'm on 450ug **most days** but have weekly slip ups where I take 1-4mg, so I think my saturation level is around 2mg? But these fuck ups makes me really tired of my taper so I'm thinking about quitting from here! 

Bad idea?

"Experiences for quitting buprenorphine from subcutaneous?. I'm currently at 8mg/week buvidal subcutaneous doses and there doesn't seem to be any lower doses for subcutaneous injections. How tough would it be to quit from this kind of dosing?

My clinic advises me to prolong the injections at first from 7 to 10 days and cease buprenorphine from there, and after a few weeks when there's no traces of buprenorphine in my urine anymore, I should start naltrexone and taper the naltrexone dose from there.

My main motivation for quitting besides the general feeling that I want to quit is that my testosterone levels are at the very bottom or below the treshold.

"Help. I know no one can make this decision for me. I want some form of help quitting opioids. I’m a bit afraid of Suboxone because I fear it might take me a steps back ( trading one opioid for another). 

My history: 
I have a couple painful conditions and I was prescribed hydromorphone 10mg a day. I was told by my doc I should start tapering so I panicked and met someone offline who started selling me hydromorphone 8mg. Fast forward- I started taking 200mg plus hydromorphone a day. I was scheduled to have surgery and it kept getting cancelled but I finally ended up having it. 

Now that I’ve had my surgery, I’ve managed to ween myself off to 24mg of hydromorphone every 4 hours. I still experience mild withdrawal symptoms just before my next dose is due. 

I’m at the end of my rope. I’m sick of constantly being in withdrawal. I’m afraid taking subs will be huge time commitment. I don’t intend staying on something for years. I don’t have urges to take hydromorphone. I only take it to get rid of withdrawals. 

Has anyone else been on a high dose of hydromorph and easily transitioned to subs ? How was the transition? What dose did you stabilize on? What would you do if you were in my shoes ? 

I don’t know if I should continue trying to taper off hydromorphone myself or if I should go on suboxone. Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated.",0,1,0,1,0,0

"Something positive about suboxone. Since most of the posts here seem to be about getting off of suboxone, I’d like to say something about how much suboxone is helping me. I’m 31 and I’ve been a heroin addict since I was 17. Since then I’ve been to jail, state prison, homeless, 15+ rehabs, halfway houses, this list goes on. I’ve destroyed many relationships and lost more than I want to think about. Suboxone has given me another chance at life. Today I have 6 months clean. I got on suboxone when I went to treatment back in October. I’m doing great, I have no cravings, I’m holding a job, and I’m saving money. Having money and not having to spend it on drugs is completely new to me. I know I’m not ready to be off suboxone. Maybe one day I’ll reevaluate my things, once I’ve had some time clean, have built up a life worth living, maybe then I’ll consider getting off of it. But for now I’m taking it as prescribed and it’s given me a chance and it’s given me hope that I can really change my life this time.

That’s been my experience so far. I was on suboxone twice before but the first time I was still shooting meth and the second time I was in a recovery house and people in NA pressured me to get off of it before I was ready.

Before I starting abusing opiates, I like to think I was cautious and careful with my recreational drug use.
Like I would do coke twice a year, usually new years and Halloween, special occasion, to give me the boost I need to withstand social interactions for long periods of time.
So, tonight there's Halloween parties that I'd like to attend. I don't want to do coke because it's too tasty and obviously I'm not as good as responsible drug use as I had previously thought. But I did get my hands a few 20mg Ritalin, I use to love these things back in my early 20's. If I do a couple tonight, does that have the potential to show up on a random urine screen, that I may or may not have to take? The doctor who prescribed the subs said I could be called in to take one randomly.
But also, those services have been sketchy due to covid, so the chance is fairly nill. I read on Google that Ritalin can give a false positive for methamphetamine.

"Just finished a super rapid taper… what WDs can I expect?. Now I know that the general consensus is that short term sub tapers lead to relapse, so as much as I appreciate any advice people may have related to that, I’m not really interested and would like my question answered 👊🏽

I was taking a mixture of oxy, morphine and other opiates pretty much daily for the second half of 2021. Not my first rodeo, I’ve used for similar amounts of time and got clean, but always ended up getting back into bad habits that lead to dependency/addiction. You know how it gets.

Anyway, I was doing it in secret and my gf discovered my stash, told my parents and there was a bit of an intervention. I came completely clean to them with all my substance abuse. Usually I’d go cold turkey (with some comfort meds admittedly) but it was 3 days before Christmas so I didn’t fancy spending Xmas eve, Xmas day and Boxing Day etc. in bed.

Over time I acquired some sublingual subutex tablets because I just knew something like this would happen. So this was my taper plan:

Day 1: 4mg 

Day 2: 2mg

Day 3: 1mg

Day 4: 1mg

Day 5: 0.5mg

Day 6: 0.5mg

Day 7: 0.25mg 

Day 8: 0.25mg (today)

So what sort of WDs can I expect? I know the long half-life and stacking effect can delay them and tbh, when I dropped down to 0.5mg I started to feel some minor WDs (worse back pain than usual, diarrhoea, slight brain fog) but largely I’ve been okay.

I’m trying so fucking hard to get back to my sobriety. But between scheduling her abortion, managing a million dollar office, trying to hide all of this from everyone, trying to keep my 15 yo from smoking all the weed in CA, and supporting everyone else’s hopes and dreams, fentanyl has been my only escape.

California Prisons are pushing suboxone on anybody with any kind of drug use history.. So I went to prison I did 16 months for having 30 g of heroin on me. While I was in prison I noticed everybody was doing Suboxone so I tried it. Liked it and decided to get on the program.  I started noticing people that they were putting on it that didn't need it. one guy was asking me about it and if you he should get on it so I asked him if he does any opiates he says no he only smokes meth so I said then no you probably won't benefit from it it would just be a worse addiction. Two or three weeks later he told me they called him in there and suggested he be put on it even though he told them that he doesn't use opiates and this happened to many others there was even one person that got called in there when I was getting my dose upped and he had no idea why he was getting called in there so when we were leaving he was telling me they were trying to put him on Suboxone and he doesn't even use drugs he said he used to smoke weed as a kid but they're recommending he get on Suboxone it just baffles me that they're doing this it's kind of f***** up. They are also offering 6 months off of your sentence if you get on the medication so there's also many people doing that.,0,0,0,1,0,0

My problem is that every single day starting around 7-8pmish I have this horrible gut wrenching depression. Like depression that’s almost worst than that of withdrawal. It’s not like I’m sad, just a miserable empty shell, black hole, hopeless fuck and I can’t take it. Earlier in the day closer to when I dose I’m fine, but then it just gets rly bad every night, and every night I just wanna relapse and say fuck the subs. But isn’t the point of subs to curb cravings? My doc assured me it’s unnecessary to take 2 doses a day as it lasts long enough to carry le 24 hours but it sure as hell doesn’t feel like it. Anyone experience something like this?

"How do you make yourself eat? Losing weight and weak… and where can I find taper schedules?. I’ve posted about this before…sorry to be repetitive.
(1) How do you force yourself to eat? What do you eat that doesn’t make you want to vomit? I have nausea that Zofran barely helps, and I’m really weak from minimal food intake, weight loss, and virtually zero physical activity. I must be down to around 100 lb now.
(2) Where do I find out how to safely taper off? Is there anything online? Or is there someone to call? 
The nausea might be in part because I am tapering too quickly? My PM doc put me on 6 mg total daily about a week ago (up from 3 mg that I started mid-May). The nausea got worse right away. I’m only taking about 1 mg every 8 hours or so now because I’m afraid to take more (and the PM doc is unavailable due to vacation), plus I sleep through taking it because I’m so damn sick.

My question is I need to pass a UA for a job I recently was offered. I'm going to call the HR person to ask about company policy today but wanted to know your guys' experiences. I have no idea what they are going to be looking at for pass/fail. I use Suboxone and Marijuana (which is legal in my state.)

"Hard to Wrap My Head Around. I began MAT to assist with my stepping out of pain management with oxy/hydro after almost 11 years. As well, I needed to find a solution to address my chronic pain (Multiple Sclerosis/Broken Neck). 

I didn’t expect the pain relief to be as good as it is. My initial plan to stay in MAT for 90 days and then taper while searching out pain solutions. 

It’s now hitting home with me that Suboxone may be with me for a very long time as it works so well. I’m grateful, but I’m also anxious by the thought of being dependent, which we all know has or will happen (85 days on).

I wanted to stop the other drugs being prescribed by pain management because they weren’t working any longer and I was simply over the monthly hassle of going through the PM gauntlet. 

The MAT visits are so easy and simple and I don’t feel on guard all the time. But still, it’s hard for me to think/know Suboxone may be the rest of my life answer for me.

Anyone else using Subs for PM and experience anxiety about being dependent to keep your life moving forward?

I  think something that may be impacting my anxiety is that I’ve had the crap scared out of me by reading some Redditor’s posts about the hell they’ve experienced while tapering and let’s not forget the fear that sits under the surface of “What if I’m in a bad accident.”   

I’m not sure what it will take to decrease my anxiety surrounding Suboxone for life. All I know is I’m feeling tremendously better... pain is controlled, so I’m checked in and present. This is a lovely state to live in a compared to going to PM just to stay out of withdrawal.

"Needing advice on going from 8 to 4mg.. I searched the sub and didn’t find a lot of definitive answers, but I also know it varies from person to person. 
I told my doctor that I was tired of feeling so apathetic with no drive for life anymore and that I was ready to taper to at least find out if the apathy is better on a low dose. I’ve been on 8mg a day for a year, and he told me to go straight to 4, (then eventually straight to 2 and then we would slow the taper down.) 


So 4 days ago I dropped to 4. The last 2 nights I only slept 4ish hours, I’ve had a dull-but- throbbing headache for 2 days, and today I woke up at 3 am with an upset stomach. Add in some general body pain/muscle cramping that was totally bearable and a little extra yawning/nose running on day 3 -and that’s the extent of it. 

I guess my questions are: •will I “stabilize” pretty soon at 4mg and possibly when?  The headache is pretty annoying, and I would prefer 8 hours of sleep, but otherwise I’m not miserable for sure. 

•is 4 to 2 going to be rough? (I have a pretty decent stash of backup from taking half of what I was prescribed the whole time Ive been on, so I can slow my taper down if needed without him prescribing more, but just curious) 

•bonus: does the apathy/loss of motivation/drive/emotion get better at low doses?

This will likely be my last post in this sub, it has been an invaluable resource to me during the very difficult first months of sobriety. A place to vent, ask questions, and generally feel less alone and miserable while withdrawing.

I need to get a Suboxone prescriber, because I am on opioid maintenance therapy and currently on suboxone  because I do not want to relapse on opiates. 
The reason I take benzos is because I am single and I go on a lot of dates and they really help me be myself when I’m first meeting a girl and I have a fair amount of  success with smashing on the first date on the times I take benzos versus the times I don’t.  

Lately I’ve been hooking up with people more often and I have been taking benzos more regularly. The issue is I am currently looking for a prescriber for Buprenorphine( suboxone ) because the one I was with was treating me like shit. I have my own mental conditions where I have trouble peeing so doing in person drug tests every single week is really really hard for me and causes me a lot of stress.  The place I worked with wasn’t willing to let me do drug tests less often or do blood tests instead of urine so I ended up leaving them since I still had a fair amount of subs left over. 

So I’m now looking for a doc and I’m sure I will need to give them at least 1 clean drug test. I’m not sure when I’ll have an appointment with the doctor who can prescribe me subs but when I do I’ll need to make sure my urine is clean.

How do y’all take your meds?. So I have always had trouble with taking my medication. The taste makes me gag. The time it takes to dissolve is sometimes a hour and I try not to even talk. So I came Across some information and curios if anybody else does this. I saw that in prisons and clinics they use a device and crush up the tablet then put it under the tounge. That way that can’t take it back out and abuse it and etc. so I started trying this and it’s a game changer for me. I got a device at Walmart that crushes it up then I shoot it under my tounge. It dissolves within a minute. Anybody else do this?,0,1,0,0,0,0

The only thing that does help with the constipation for me is the stimulant laxative but you’re not supposed to take those every day.

"Need advice with those on bupe.me. So recently I started a dose of Sublingual suboxone 4mgs 2/ a day. Well after a few days I noticed this dose wasn’t cutting it as far as cravings and feeling normal so I spoke on video with a bupe NP. She agreed to up my dose to 8mgs 1.5 times a day so 12mgs total. Since I’m in Cali she has to forward the recommendations and get the new Rx approved by the Dr and then Walgreens would fill the updated script. Luckily from my original script I have enough films to cover the rec additional dose and 12 mgs seems like the number for now that is best. However it’s been since yesterday morning and still no new Rx has been updated to my pharmacy. They are aware I’m waiting but is this typical wait time for bupe.me? Luckily I have my original script to add to equal the 12 mgs but if I didn’t I would be concerned of a relapse or something. So

I should mention i used to take double that a while ago but my dealer keeps getting different pills ranging from 5mg perc to 40mg oxycontin so i was getting sick of it and decided to stay at around 20-40mg tops.

what would you do ?. I've been on IV fent on and off for years and recently had two years clean and then relapsed hard and went on a several months long bender. I found myself in the hospital a week ago for a medical problem and I was also trying to get off fent so I went to the ER in super bad withdrawal. Long story short I got a really good doctor who put me on 2 mg Dilaudid for a few days so I'm not in withdrawal or in pain from the medical thing that put me in the ER and I have an appt with her tomorrow morning. What I'm wondering is shes given me the option of helping me transfer from the Dilaudid to subs or helping me taper off the Dilaudid and be on nothing and I'm really torn about what to do. I don't want to go back into withdrawal. It's excruciating coupled with the medical problem I'm having.

"Every little bit helps...I hope. Been a while since I updated. I been stuck at .25 for a while now. All of the taper from 1mg and under has been the most symptomatic time for me, as I’ve noticed it is with others. I’m tired all the time, rls, creepy crawlies, insides churning, and the never-ending sneezing fits. 

My rule has been to cut my dose a couple of weeks after the symptoms subside from dropping down, but I haven’t been able to stabilize at .25 yet. It’s been a while. I wonder if it has to do with the difficulty in getting a consistent dose; some days feel better than others. Thinking I might just drop again anyway, or even just jump from here. As a former high dose maintenance user, it’s so surprising how shitty this tiny bit feels. I’m beating myself up a bit because of all the cold-turkey withdrawal kicks I did off H. I feel like a total wimp. Maybe it’s just because I’m a lot older and less used to being that uncomfortable.

"Quick question:. I’m on day 9 of jumping off 1mg after 3.5 years on subs with a slow but steady taper down from 8mg. 

First week I allowed myself dab pens, which I don’t usually allow myself cuz I get addicted to them easy and I manage better with only flower. Funny how I’m still an addict in that way 😅 I stopped the carts in week two and I have not been able to get a high at all from weed (flower). I do get dependent on carts easy tho, and I’ve even withdrawn from them in the past when stopping. I’m hoping it’s just cuz of the cart and in a few days I’ll be able to get high from weed(flower)again! Lol. I’m learning this lesson for the 2nd or 3rd time being clean. At one point in my first year of clean time, I had like a 1-1.5 month bender per say with buying a new cart every single day, spending 40+$ every day for a lil over a month! They are not to be played with, and that’s why I don’t buy them usually! But I let myself for the sub wd. Bad idea, I know just how much I’m affected by them. I feel like non addicts who use concentrates don’t have the same problems if these use pens everyday...but my first addiction was dabbing so not sure. 

Anyone have any info on if it’s just cuz of going hard on like 2g of carts in a week and then going back to flower? Usually I can still feel it a lil after using a cart for a week or so but not this time around. I also haven’t used a cart in months cuz I’ve been really good about not giving in to the desire. The pens makes me a straight zombie anyways. I pretty much nod off when using them all day. I was addicted to dabbing before dope! I really wanna be able to feel the relaxation of weed again! Maybe in a few days it’ll come back I’m assuming. I feel dumb for using the carts, just created another problem. That’s why I only smoke flower, cuz carts give me issues.

"Been on suboxone for 3 months. Plz help. Cravings never go away. I decided I only wanted to be on medication that can be prescribed to me by a doctor. I was using Kratom and my life was happy. I was doing great I wasn’t craving other drugs. I was striving in work and school. 

an incident occurred where I had a seizure due to due to the Kratom. At that moment I knew that I needed to only be taking medications prescribed by a doctor and not try to self-medicate. I’ve had struggles in the past with opioid addiction and other drugs. So I wanted to try suboxone cause it’s a partial agonist like Kratom so I thought it might help keep me motivated and live life right and not crave drugs like the Kratom did

"149 Days Off Suboxone. This has been quite the journey…It’s been a few days shy of a year since I started tapering + 149 days since my last dose of 0.075mg. No relapses, no Kratom, no prescriptions…just me, slowly remembering who I used to be. 

It was easy to accept a troubled state of mind as a permanent condition that needed to be suppressed & sedated with pills…it was harder to confront reality head on and work through the things that made me feel that way in the first place…but it has been far more rewarding and fulfilling to do so in the long run. 

I don’t feel anxiety, guilt, and shame when I wake up anymore. I feel a little light burning inside and a sense of purpose.

"Finally making the jump to subs after years of god knows what kind of dope I’ve been getting. Long story short I got sick and tired of being sick and tired. I used an app called groups recover together and it has worked well so far, already got my first script of subs but here’s where it gets to the not so glamorous part; 
I was using anywhere from 1g-2g of most likely fent/tranq dope. My last use was Monday night around 9-10pm and I told myself I’m done. I watched my fiancé practically overdose a few days prior on this shit and it was no joke. Today is now Thursday, I took my 8mg strip and split it into 2mg and figured since I was feeling some serious wd symptoms I’d be fine to start slow and go from there like my nurse told me to do. I should also mention I did a small bump of crystal Wednesday night around 10pm because for some reason it helps get my mind off how shitty I’m feeling. So I took 2mg of my subs around 5am Thursday thinking I’d be good - around 6:30-7am I am feeling even more hellish; cold/hot sweats, stomach cramping and it was like every bone in my body was aching. I was nervous to take any more of my subs because I wasn’t sure if that was what did it in the first place (I have literally no experience with subs besides trying them a couple times when I couldn’t score) so I caved and took 2mg of Xanax around 8-9am just so I could pass out get through the worst of it. I slept all day. Now I’m just wondering when/how much of my subs I should start? I think I’m good for tonight, I’ll probably pass out here soon but I already know I’m going to feel like shit when I wake up and I HAVE to work - I already had to call out today.

"Planning to use the Bernese method, let’s see if I got this right. So I have my suboxone, I have a script for clonidine, and I’m ready to try again. 
I read a lot about the Bernese method, but nothing along the lines of a guide. I figure it would probably be best to start it off in withdrawal. Last time I gave myself roughly 48 hours of no fentanyl, but that was a baaaaad idea. Precipitated withdrawal was a bitch. At that time I was able to last about two days after taking the sub but of course my dealer texted me that night asking if I was good and I didn’t have the strength to say no. 

So my plan is give myself 72 hours of detox. Usually I’m sick as a dog well before that but I’m gonna really try hard to make it to the 72nd hour. Once that happens I plan to take a small amount of bupe. I’m thinking roughly .5mg and see how I feel once that kicks in. I just want to be okay enough to still work, but we’ll see about that. 
So I take the .5 and just wallow in my misery for however king but then before work take a small amount of fentanyl to keep my from being too sick. This is where I get kinda lost. So at that 3 day mark do I just taper down the fent while tapering up the bupe so I’m at 8mg of dupe within 5-8 days and no fent by the end?

"Anyone gone from prescribed Subs back to prescribed Oxycodone?. I've been on 10mg Subutex (suboxone minus the Naloxone) for almost 4 weeks, which was prescribed by my pain specialist - prior to this, I was on 50mg daily of Oxycodone. Unfortunately the side effects of the Subs have been extreme, with headaches, nausea and sedation. The pain relief has been so-so, but to get good pain coverage I have to take the Subs as 2mg doses every few hours - if I did 6mg mornings/4mg nights as initially prescribed, the pain relief was crap (suboxone's analgesic properties only last 4-8 hours). 

Due to the side effects of the Subs, I've been unable to work or study, and my hobby of piloting small planes has also been canned for the entire duration of the Subutex treatment. Basically, life has sucked.

As a result, I'm now being rotated back on to Oxycodone, but my specialist has only prescribed me 15mg per day. The plan is to stop taking Subs on Saturday night, take nothing on Sunday, then take 3 x 5mg Oxycodone on Monday. Looking at Morphine Equivalence, the amount of bupe in my system equates to 200mg per day, so I'm extremely concerned I'm going to go into withdrawals.

Has anyone here had the experience of going from Subs back to traditional painkillers such as Oxycodone or MS Contin? Is 15mg per day going to be enough to stop withdrawals?

"Has anyone ever heard of this type of taper?... I’ve tried to come off Suboxone for quite a few years. Every time I get down to 2mgs I chicken out & go back up. My question is in regards to a doctor telling me a story of many different patients he used to see many years back. He said when the patient showed up, (on the agreement on both the doctor and the patient’s acknowledgment) the doctor would (behind closed doors) take a 4mg strip and dissolve it into a standard sized pill bottle. Everyday he instructed the patient to “take a teaspoon every morning”. He did this until he was down to 2mg & eventually to nothing. He said he added Tang orange drink when he stopped adding Suboxone to the pill bottle to ease the patient’s mind. He said this has worked for a large group of people. Has anyone ever done this or heard of this? Yes, I understand that this medication is taking sublingually. This is why I'm asking. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

"(Canada)PMS (Pharmascience) generic Suboxones used to be the best (well that and the first ones, Tevas, but they're not carried by my pharmacy anymore), now they've changed forms (flat sides). I get used to them and now they are giving the worst of all sub gens I ever had : ACTAVIS. My pharmacy right now is staffed with old ladies who replace the usual staff who are on vacation, so for the first time in about 8 years I get told that she will call me back. I want to verify with them if this is just temporary like the last time they were only having those 155 / Actavis logo (Moon) Suboxones....

Just 2 months ago, I was getting Pharmascience (PMS), one of the best overall generics company in Canada, they looked and tasted less like Mr Clean (heh, despite my name, not a fan of the odor or taste I guess), when I had the brand name ones, it was clearly indicated they had lime and lemon natural and artificial flavouring in there, I guess to make snorting a bit painful (it was, I didn't do that for long) and to those who insist on IV'ing them, even the best SteriFilt at .22 microns will not remove a flavour that will stay in the liquid (just a hint not to bother doing that - tsk tsk, for your veins sake). 

They looked just the same as the brand name, N8 and the Sword, except at some point the sides were flattened,back in June or so and worked fine. The Actavis pills I found were very mild on the taste (which is good for one's teeth), but the effects are not as profoundly relieving as the PMS ones.

2 weeks ago, I got what was the rest of the PMS pills, they bothered putting on the sticker saying the pills might look different because I had a blend of PMS and ACT pills. Might be considering the film since it showed up here this year next time I meet my doc in a few weeks, he offered them but apparently there's some dose adjusting that I really don't feel like going through if it's something that could have me need to stay inpatient for a few days, stayed inpatient 9 years ago when I got on methadone first, Suboxone was pretty new then and not paid for by any insurance in my province, so it wasn't discussed much, the 6 days in the inpatient clinic was such hell (they mixed alcoholics and cokeheads with those addicted to their painkillers a bit too much....theres no heroin here thank god...if there is, those drive a LONG way to get something that isn't likely worth it since pills just as strong are going around anyways).   


tl;dr Anyone else from Canada (or not) find the Actavis generic Suboxones the lowest tier when it comes to generic Subs? Because PMS and Teva generics are way better and almost impossible to differentiate from the brand name, except the brand name's taste is even stronger and more awful. I hear the films soon will be having a choice for an Orange taste, like the original US Suboxones, I told my doctor : about time! Those lime and lemon extracts cost me a whole lot of dental work! I had 2 small cavities in 30 years or so before getting on Subs, after that, I probably got over 25 fillings (TG I have insurance that pays for white filling everywhere and not just the front teeth). Sorry for the long post, I'm kind of not enjoying being 3/4 where I should be with these Actavis subs.",1,1,0,0,0,0
"Soon switching to Sublocade in hopes to finalize taper from Suboxone.. Over a year ago, I was self-medicating with Kratom. It helped me feel better living with schizoeffective disorder. Schizoeffective disorder is an illness that has symptoms that happen in both schizophrenia and bi-polar. I have the depressive variety. Lots of anhedonia and avolition over the years.

By late summer 2021 I was on better medications so I sought to address my self medication with Kratom, I knew it was unhealthy. 

Since my medications are more helpful than before, I didn’t need Kratom anymore. I went on Suboxone 8mg. I was decreasing my dose of Subs each month, until I was down to 1mg in January. Well I began experiencing horrible burn out at work, I learned I simply can’t work as many hours as I’d like to. When I have pushed myself to work more than 20 hours I destabilize mentally and sometimes exhibit a need for more self medication. In February I was going back up on Suboxone, I was taking 2mg, or 3mg per day. Finally this month I was up to 4mg.

One of you guys told me about sublocade. I’ve seen the commercials and I remembered that, but anyway I talked to my provider and she’s happy to put me on sublocade. This will allow me to have an easier time sticking with the plan and I will taper off that way. Thanks for the recommendation, I start next month.",0,1,0,0,1,0

Found out some shit that I’m now glad she left. But ultimately exited. First day has been nothing but a little sweats and a bit moody.

"New to sub have a couple questions. Hi! I've been lurking on this subreddit and several others for a while and now I'm finally stepping up to talk. I feel....nervous?

I've been taking 120-180mg oxy for about 7 months. On oxy illicitly for about 2.5 years at lower doses. It's amazing that it's taken this long but I am finally at a point where I simply cannot afford this anymore. 

I quit last year for 6 weeks using Kratom and ativan. (Don't congratulate me I only did it because my plug lost his supply.) It was abjectly miserable. I honestly didn't feel mentally even a little bit better after 6 weeks. I was internally debating if I wanted to live like that.  I found out my plug got a new supplier and went back to it. 

A couple of times in the last year I've stopped for a few days at a time using subs, so I have a little bit of an idea what dose to use, or at least I thought I did. 

Although I'm somewhat undecided, I think I want to try subs for a relatively short time then taper off. I think that is risky for me but I also don't want to stay on them forever.  After reading a lot on here I'm sure y'all would agree!

I started a couple days ago taking 4mg at 6am when I wake up to take another med (I have several weird health conditions and am on a lot of medications just not pain meds.) Day 1&2 I felt pretty good until midafternoon, a little bit of chills/sweating but completely tolerable. By midafternoon I was feeling crappy but it sorta seems like most people dose twice a day so I waited until 7pm to take another 4mg and then I felt better. (The last times I tried subs I found 1-2 mgs wasn't enough for me but 4mg did the trick.)  


Today, Day 3, I took the 4mg at 6am. I was VERY groggy and had a hard time getting up. I continued feeling crappy and actually got back into bed. Finally at 2pm I took 2mg. That helped pretty dramatically until 4:30. Suddenly I got VERY fatigued and nauseous. I made it through grocery shopping but had to lie down when I got home. I hadn't eaten much because I've not had much appetite today. So I'm sure that was a factor. But I don't think it was the only factor.   


My regular oxy WDs manifest mainly as severe lack of motivation and fatigue, major irritability, lack of appetite, as well as of course runny nose and hot/cold sweats.

Finally at 7pm I took another 4mg and now I'm feeling better. 

My 2 questions are:  
Do you think I need to dose 3 times a day? Is that common?

Do you think this is just my oxy WDs kind of ""bleeding through"" or am I not adequately medicated on the subs?  


Thank you in advance.

Basically am in the same place today regardless of me taking that film?   I thought I had COVID so I took the film just to see what was up.   I immediately better for 24 hours.  I guess I'm asking is it possible to continue to ""taper"" if one took a small dose 1/week?   I have 1mg left of film and I won't take it if it prolongs the process.

Thank you!",0,1,0,0,1,0

pills or films?. So I'm just curious what everyone thinks is better but mainly what everyone thinks dissolves faster. I used to think the films were the best and dissolved the quickest but then one day I tried a pill and realized I could chew it up a little to make it dissolve faster.

"Needing assistance urgently, can anyone answer?. I have been on Subutex for several months and have abstained from heroin and other opioid use since I started taking the medication.

Foggy/ shaky feeling.. Hey guys. I’ve been on Suboxone for like 3 months and am in the process of getting insurance that pays for the sublocade my doctor prescribed so I can get off of this stuff and not have to take a drug everyday. And for the most part I haven’t had any problem with the Suboxone in the months that I used it until two days ago. The way I normally take it is I break a 8 milligram strip into 4 2 milligram parts and take it spread out across the day 4 different times normally at least 4 hours apart. Then two days ago I took my third dose of the day at 4:30 and my 4th dose an hour and a half later where as I would normally wait until 8 or 9 for the fourth dose. And I felt great after taking the fourth dose. But then two hours later I ate a few pieces of pizza and all of a sudden felt horrible. I felt super foggy and as I tried to sit still I felt real shaky. And it was clearly triggered by the food. Now this situation had happened to me before on Kratom and fellow Kratom users and would call it “the wobbles” and it would always happen to me when I took more Kratom then I should and then ate some carbs. It was always really uncomfortable but then I would simply just not take Kratom for awhile and it would go away. But now with Suboxone that happened two days ago. Then yesterday I still felt foggy and got a head ache when I took my Suboxone and then today felt foggy and shaky when I took it. Now the past two days I didn’t feel as bad as the day this first happened and I feel like as time goes on it will get better and better. But has anyone else experienced this? It’s very frustrating.,0,0,1,0,0,0

"Subutex Taper -- please advise!. Hi There,

First time visitor/poster to this subreddit. Just wanted to get some feedback on what I can expect self-tapering from 8mg to 4mg of 'Subutex (buprenorphine with NO naloxone).

I've been taking bupe since the end of 2016 and am so happy to say I never had a relapse on dope or painkillers since then! It's a straight up miracle. First I was taking 16mg, then I brought myself to 12mg, then 8mg.. I've been on 8mg for months now and I started taking bupe every other day instead of daily and its been more or less fine. I would dose once I started to feel sweaty. I asked my doctor to help me get off subutex as I am sick of the nasty taste and I'm sick of being so dependent on a medication.

5 months ago I got off Klonopin after 12 years of dependency on that shit,  I just want to be free from controlled substances. I feel like I can't truly be  free unless I'm off these habit-forming medications. My doctor doesn't think coming off subs is a good idea right now, mostly because subutex has worked so well on me. I'm still in ""early recovery"" from the benzos, and he is wary about making too many big changes at the same time.

I decided to test the waters and break my subutex in half - 4mg every other day. I started doing this like 4 days ago. I noticed last night I had no appetite and needed to go lay down due to feeling nauseous. Am I imagining this? 8mg to 4mg shouldn't be a big deal, right?  I do not have my expectations or facts straight so I am turning to you guys--  Is 8mg to 4mg Subutex a big jump? How severe would withdrawal symptoms be? Am I making a big mistake disobeying my doctor? And lastly, where do I go from here? Thank you guys so much for reading and god bless.",0,1,1,0,1,0

"Help! PWD from taking Suboxone. My husband was actively using Fentanyl for about a year. He did a slow wean and then went almost 4 days with none, and used tramadol from the doctor to make it through. He took his first dose of Suboxone around 1pm today and it sent him into PWD. Using info from what I read— we micro-dosed 2mg every 2 hours, with the exception of the last hour. He’s up to 16mg so far. How much can he take in 24 hrs and when will it the withdrawals end? I have tried calling the paging line for the doctor 4 times and haven’t had any luck with someone calling back. He also has comfort meds like Gab, Clonidine, trazodone and hydroxyzine but I don’t know what he can actually take while on sub. The nausea has subsided some, I’m trying my best to keep him hydrated.

"Complexish question about restarting Suboxone. I never really had a true opioid addiction but after a tragic life event and with already existing depression, I started taking low dose opioids in order to keep up with my career. They completely obliterated my depression without euphoria as long as I kept the dose low. 

Eventually I knew I would become addicted because I was requiring an increase in dose to keep the depression at bay so I went and asked for a buprenorphine script. The buprenorphine did exactly what the opioids did for my depression. I felt normal for the first time in my life. 

Anyway, I recently decided to taper off and to start Stablon (tianaptine) because I’m moving to a country where buprenorphine will not be prescribed the way it is in the US and Stablon is an available antidepressant. I thought, my opioid receptors seem to be involved in my depression so maybe Stablon will work for me but it didn’t or at least it was making me so sick to my stomach that I could stay on it longer than 6 days. 

I horrible and didn’t want to go through withdrawal while awaiting another buprenorphine prescription so I took a nibble of a 30mg oxycodone that I had sitting around for years. It was surprisingly intense and I’m glad I don’t have more because it felt great. 

My buprenorphine script is ready now so I’m wondering….

I too roughly 10mg of oxycodone about 35 hours ago. Before that, I’d stopped Stablon for 4 days. Am I safe to introduce .5mg of buprenorphine? My stomach is a mess right now so I assume I am withdrawing a bit.

My question is should we just let them go through the withdrawal process or if I get the script, should we try to taper? If we taper, what suggestions are there for this?",1,0,1,0,1,0

"24+. Am I the only person who benefits from a high dose? I was terrified suboxone want going to help me at first. It eventually did and it works to this day. It's been 3 years no issues. I can't be the only one out there that benefits from a high dosage. I personally am on 32mgs. 12-8-12. I do play with it and I know I can go to about 24mgs if I have to, without making myself feel overwhelming fatigue, insomnia,  etc.... Anything under that and I wouldn't make it. 32mgs is my sweet spot.

"Suboxone and problems urinating. So I’ve taken subs since getting off Percs about 4 years ago or so.. since I started I noticed that it’s been getting harder and harder to piss.

"Choice between Butrans and switching to full agonist then inducing Zubsolv, which one is the best?. So I’ve done it again and put myself in another horrible spot. I’ve been using fent cut black tar for about 2 months now and  my life has completely gone down the toilet; all I do is use and I’m about to lose my house from it. 

I have a choice of micro inducing via 2 butrans 20mcg/hr patches or switching from the tar to OxyContin ER. 

I have 10mg tablets, the OP tablets and I would just take them until there is no more withdrawal and stay on it for 3 days to make sure my body has switched from the tar to the OPs, then do a regular sub induction from the OPs to Zubsolv. 

I can’t decide which method to use. I know with the Butrans that I’m required to not use anything for the 2 days the patches are on until I start dosing the Zubsolv, and I’m worried about the fact that the OxyContin last so long in my system that I will end up having to wait in WDs way longer.

I'll dab a little on the strips or pieces of strips before putting them back into the foil pouch, which helps against humidity. I also store my tiny pieces folded in individual wax paper with a dab of corn starch.

Need some help and guidance during my next step in the taper process.

Short background:
I was on heroin between age 15-21 when I got on the first sub program in my country. I wouldn’t be a live without it and I am grateful. 

It’s been more years on it then I want to admit and the latest year I have been tapering as I want to quit.

My doc says jump from 2 mg but in my country the experience they have isn’t great and I see best practices in other countries differ so I am leaning towards going lower before I jump.

2) Supplements, food and water intake?Exercise, meditation, hell I even try some all out there stuff IF it helps :).

Snorting suboxone. Been on suboxone for about 7mo now. When i stopped doing H i took it regularly under the tongue and weaned down to under 2mg a day then been snorting it since. (Pill form) i usually do one line in morning and one at night. Im trying to wean down and get off but the thought of month long withdrawals scare me. Do you think that snorting it causes a shorter half life? Ive relapsed back to twice oxy before and was able to get high within 14-24hrs after last sub use. So since wd is kicking in faster the wd should be shorter right? Im not a doc so i could be wrong lol. Gonna try getting down to <1mg a day of sub in the next month but its hard to taper after getting under 2mg a day. Any advice? I feel im in a unique situation as i was able to go on MAT without the help of a doctor cause i was given 3 bottles worth of sub from a friend i used to smoke H with. I dont even like suboxone anymore and am scared for the day i run out. Trying to taper asap with little to no physical WD since i work a good job and have a nice social life since getting on sub. Any tips are much appreciated. I might sound like a dumbass but this is the predicament im in so sorry lol. If u have advice for getting off sub as comfortably as possible let me know.

"I lost another friend to fentanyl that leaves behind two boys and a teenager. Reconnected because her husband died of cancer.  My wife died years ago of a heroin overdose.

Clean time, her eldest is seventeen, two young boys.  Beautiful photos on social media.  

Grandma out of state is taking the kids for now.  My heart aches for the little ones are 9 and 11.

During the pandemic she relapsed one time after years of sobriety working steps with NA, went to the hospital, was infected with COVID, and posted that it was sheer luck she was alive.  

We reconnected again and planned to meet when this stupid pandemic subsides. 

She got vaccinated, cleaned up her act, and picked up a white chip.  

She posted her NA chips as the months rolled by.  I have my feelings about NA and I expressed it to her.  I even suggest MAT because I felt she was high risk. 

Yesterday sober with her parents out and about during the holidays.  She is beautiful really pleasing on the eyes.  Funny and the kind that lights up a room.  

Today I found out I will be attending another funeral. 

My memories have deceased friends that overdosed talking to each other.  She joins that club on my memories.

I am sad that more MAT is not given out to those that had overdosed at the hospital or on scene after narcan.  The stigma of taking suboxone that you are really not sober makes me angry.  I lost all my best friends neighbors high school classmates college friends wife, and now her.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Is suboxone effective at all in treating pain in opiate naive people? (dentist emergency). So for context, my cousin has some infected tooth filling, probably needs a root canal that he’s awaiting, and his dr refuses to give him pain meds, only antibiotics. He has no history of abuse, they just don’t want to “prescribe young people narcotics” or some shit. But he’s literally been crying from the pain and unable to sleep. 

He’s just been taking Tylenol and I want to help if I can. I know the first time I took suboxone I was completely opiates naive like him and I probably took 1mg and just got sick. 

I obviously don’t want to introduce him to hard shit and he isn’t interested. And don’t want to jump to subs if he’ll just get sick. That’ll make everything 10x worse. I’m just wondering if anyone has tried to use subs in this context in an emergency?",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Me again...here’s my fear:. I’ve been posting and reading here since I jumped from 2mg subs in mid-July. I can’t say I’m not an addict because I admit I love being in altered states. 

However, I also have degenerative osteoarthritis throughout my body. It’s in my hands, feet, lower back and I’ve broken major bones that never quite healed right. And I have a huge bunion on my right foot. Basically, I’m always in some mid-high level of pain. It’s especially bad after being still for any period of time. I’m almost 50 but look like I’m 30 (it’s the only good genes I inherited). But, I think it makes it difficult for doctors to take me seriously. I look healthy and young until they X-ray my body. Even then, they don’t want to prescribe painkillers because (duh) they’re addictive. 

So I went the suboxone route for 5 years. I jumped through all the typical hoops and the doctors office got to know me. They understood that I was taking suboxone for pain management and taking it as prescribed. No dirty pee-tests because suboxone helped with my pain—I didn’t need anything else to function/work/live. I only drank alcohol and the docs overlooked it. We had an understanding at the office which is RARE, I know. 

And then, they had to start cracking down on alcohol. Zero tolerance even for casual drinkers like myself. I decided that I was tired of peeing in a cup every other month and I simply don’t want to fully abstain from drinking. 

TLDR/what happens when my degenerative osteoarthritis makes life unbearable? With the way the government is cracking down on opioids, will they be available when I desperately need them to physically get out of bed? I’m probably ok for another 10-15 years with gabapentin, Tylenol, Advil and yoga but my bones are literally breaking down and the cartilage in my joints is practically gone.

"Induction at 39 weeks, can I stop subutex a day or 2 before so I can have pain management options for induced labor?. I'm terrified of the pain and I'm an SA survivor. Quite frankly, I'm scared of vaginal delivery as well. I've heard induction is more painful than natural labor. 


One of my suboxone providers told me I could quit taking subutex for a day or 2 to be started on other pain management options that I wouldn't have access too if I were to take it on that day. I will check in with my OBGYN and my providers tomorrow to see what I can do to be as comfortable as possible during vaginal delivery.

"Update 7.5 weeks. So it’s been 7.5 weeks! I guess it’s been a few days since I last updated. I was having a lot of trouble with a few issues like having my period and being sick plus PAWS. It was really hard but I got through it and feel normal again! Tired but more normal for sure. I’m not dizzy like I was and I’m not having that awful disconnected derealization feeling. 

Before I was even on Suboxone, as some of you know, I was abusing my Vicoprofen that I had for my back for a few months. Not enough to get on Suboxone for 4.5 years but I obviously did end up getting addicted to Suboxone. Almost every day for 4.5 years, I took Advil for my back. Being it’s a blood thinner, I ended up bruising insanely easily. My legs were covered in bruises and having a puppy jumping on me just made me bruise even more. I have to get to my primary to get a full blood work up to check my liver after all that Advil. I am also going to be seeing a new orthopedic to figure out what’s going on. 

That being said, on Saturday I was in such immense pain I took 10mg of Oxycodone. Of course it made me feel good and took the pain away. I was dancing the day before and fucked up my neck haha. I’m in pain daily and being I don’t wanna keep taking Advil, I’ve taken 1 of the 5mg Oxycodone each day since Saturday except today. I’m not withdrawing or anything. Obviously my moms holding on to the pain meds and I’m not taking more than that. I’m very self aware thankfully and my mom, my therapist and my best friend know about it. I’m not getting the exercise I should be. I’m not being kept busy. It all makes sense as to why I’d want it. So I’m going to be working on that for sure. I just feel like a total failure. I feel I cheated. I actually feel I disappointed everyone here and I’m sorry if I did😔. I wouldn’t consider this a “relapse”. But I’m so sad. 

Other than that issue, I’m actually doing well. The last 3 weeks were definitely tough but I had no choice than to push through cause what else could I do?

"Sublingual Tablets. Whole or Crushed?. First and foremost, when I say crushed, I still mean using it sublingually. Not intranasal. Anyways.    When I was in rehab, the nurses administered suboxone by finely crushing tablets,  putting it in a medicine cup,  and the patients pour it under their tounge.  Now to my understanding, they did this mainly to keep people from cheeking the tablet for selling or saving or what-have-you. It of course still worked and gave people the therapeutic effects. Well my question is, could it actually be better to crush tablets this way? Would it increase the absorption/surface area vs just putting the whole tablet under the tongue?

Side question. With the tablets, I often have a problem where a pool of orange/pink saliva remains under my tongue after it dissolves. If I lay flat on my back, it decreases this a bit. Am I doing something wrong or is that normal?",0,1,0,0,0,0

Each time after a period of prolonged abuse I’ve entered a maintenance program and I think I may have either not remained stable long enough or tapered too quickly because I’ve always relapsed within a few months after tapering. This has happened with methadone once and suboxone twice. My longest taper was over a 5 month period after 6 months stability.

The reason I don’t want to stay on suboxone is because while it does help me stay sober, it’s always given me a sort of tiredness and brain fog that can sometimes be quite distressing and debilitating.

I’m currently at 8mg and have been stable for 6 months. I plan on remaining at this dose for another 6 months and then tapering as slow as possible over a one year period; how realistic is this? In the past I think my problem was setting a fixed “end date” and then jumping, regardless of anything else. Perhaps not setting a target date and taking as much time as possible is more sensible. 

Any feedback or experiences would be very helpful.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"The Great Dilemma. I've been on Suboxone now for about 6 months. I had an off-and-on 10 year run with opiates. I can honestly say Suboxone is a huge part of why I am still clean and my life is in order. I can't help but wonder where to go now. I don't want to be on it the rest of my life, but this is the best I've ever felt. I'm lucky that I found a doctor that takes my Insurance and my prescriptions are covered, so money isn't a huge factor, although missing work to see the doctor is a bit of an annoyance. I'm thinking of tapering off long and slow, and seeing where it goes. I would love to hear what others experiences have been. Cheers!",0,0,0,0,1,0

My question is, is Suboxone useful for cravings and paws or is it mainly just prescribed for detox? I wanna bring it up to my psychiatrist but i don’t want him to think i’m searching for drugs and shit ya know? Ive tried naltrexone and it didn’t do much for me if at all.",0,0,1,1,0,0

"Suboxone, like never before.. I picked up my script “Dr Reddy’s” brand, unfortunately. 
And there are “white lumps” in it, I have had the same brand before, awhile ago, but it didn’t have these weird white bumps in them. I would post a picture but this sub doesn’t allow it.

"Realistically, what am I looking at? How bad would it really be?. I'm currently on 12 to 16mg (depends on the day) of Suboxone films each day. I HATE it. I'm not normal. I can't feel or think normally. It messes with my other mental health issues. I feel like my life is on hold until I can get off this crap. I even got down to 8mgs pretty easily at one point, against my doctor's advice, and I felt a lot better, but then I made the stupid decision to go back up to what the doctor wanted me on. Ugh. 

I've gotten clean cold turkey twice. Once in 2013 from around 300mgs of oxycodone a day, and I did it the old fashioned way... In jail. The next time, two years ago, I went cold turkey from H for the first 6 or 7 days until a family member convinced me to get prescribed Suboxone. Both times it was miserable, but short lived. The problem is I've never gotten off subs before, and from what I understand the half life is much longer, therefore the withdrawal stage is much longer. 

I've been doing the slow taper, but I'm sooo over it. How bad would bad be if I just buckled down and went off cold? I'm sure it would be rough, but would it be worth having my life back finally? I just don't realistically know what I'm looking at here because I've never experienced it. I've gone as long as 3 or 4 days between doses multiple times, which wasn't too bad, but that's the extent of my experience. 

I've even wondered if theoretically, if I went back on a small dose of oxycodone for 30 days or so, in a supervised environment of course, if I could then get off the oxy much quicker and easier than the subs. But, I don't even know if it works that way or not. I'm just trying to think of anything that might work.

I just need help... Please. I'm desperate to feel like myself again. I feel tortured, and I hate it.

"Dose For Depression. The past couple years I've been depending on Kratom probably twice weekly for depression. It's illegal in my state now, and I've realized how essential it is as a part of my depression regimen. Weeks ago I was rx'ed 2mg sub tablets, and of course realized that dose is way too high.

Best way to start using subs. Okay so I’m in the process of quitting opiates. I was using Kratom an methadone for about a week then went back to using. I’ve been able to get just straight heroin no fent in it at all. Would it be okay to wait about 18hours an start off with a small sliver of suboxone an work my way up? I also have subutex but they’re pills an don’t kno if I would be able to break it down into small enough dose. I just want to use the 26 subs I have an hopefully in about a month can slightly taper off using the subs an just work on staying sober. I’m sure by then small amount of Kratom would be able to help me normalize after using subs for about 3 weeks.

""The first and only FDA-approved, non-opioid, non-addictive treatment for relief of multiple symptoms of opioid withdrawal.""

That's the drug company's tag line.  They're claiming this med can alleviate aches and pains, stomach cramps, feeling sick, muscle spasms, insomnia or problems sleeping, feelings of coldness/chills, muscle tension, heart pounding, runny eyes and yawning.  You take the pill four times a day for a week, when you're detoxing off opioids. The max you should use it is 14 days.  You can take it along with subs, methadone, or vivitrol / naltrexone.

"Day 10 detox. Ok before I begin, I've been through this 3 times in my life. 

1st success after a few days, was back at work day 9. 

2nd no way- drove me to insanity and was dumb years ago and failed 12 days in. 

On my 3rd time 10 days in today.

10 years prescribed to me, first detox got in when it was very controlled like a few months, taper and no more. Very clinical and strict. Eventually it morphed into, you put big cash upwards of $300 and walk out with 6 months huge script. But its like anything else and I believe our responsibility to choose what we buy and put in our bodies. So withdrawl situations vary greatly, based on doctor, history and length on. 

So today, I slept about 4 1/2 hrs going on a week, of two sleep cycles with stomach pains upon waking up. My brain is still sorting it out, but my body just is run down from lack of real sleep. It's very mental but in a physical rebuilding way. Hurts my bones, but what I'm doing...

I'm just letting it be. I'm on medicinal cannabis a lot, it's the only way things feel ok without crying sometimes from how taxing this is, or just going to a bad place. I stay away from prescribed benzos during day light hours. I just have to remember 10 days is a great achievement, but it's still pretty early. 

I'm just so lucky, I have 3 more weeks of no responsibilities to try and get this checked and then go on a vacation.

Today will be day 15 and I've I'm still taking both Diazepam and Gabapentin. Today, before work, I took 10mg Diazepam and 300mg. On my lunch break, I took another 10mg Diazepam and another 300mg Gabapentin.

"Attempted to jump at .4 mg and failed.. Need some advice. I got down to .4mg daily and my Doctor said you can just stop now. When I did I went through three days of pretty awful anxiety, no sleep etc.  I wouldnt say full blown WD's but, it was pretty awful. I couldnt figure out why I felt this way and then I thought let me try taking .4mg of my Bupe again and see if that is the cause. Sure enough a day later I was fine. Basically back to where I was before. I still want off this stuff. The horrendous side effects at .4mg are almost gone but, there is still something not right with me since I began taking this (in my opinion) horrible medication. So my question is. If I go down to .3 for a week than .2 for another week and then .1 for the last week will my WD's be almost un-noticeable when I stop?

Please help- I'm trying to avoid precipitated withdrawal. So yesterday I took 2 mg Suboxone in the morning and another 2 mg around 4 pm. This morning I took 30 mg methadone bc I thought I had run out of sub films. My question is can I take more Suboxone tonight without precipitating withdrawal? I'm thinking I would be okay bc the Suboxone from yesterday  is probably still occupying my receptors and the methadone today probably just topped them off. Obviously I want to avoid being thrown into withdrawal so I figured I'd see if anyone knew the answer to this. Thanks.,0,1,1,0,0,0

"Do any non-opiods offer the same kind of pain relief as buprenorphine?. After a long battle with chronic pain that started at 18, a couple months ago in the final quarter of 2021, I switched from tramadol to buprenorphine in the form of patches, starting at 5mg, and I’m currently on 10mg. 

It’s worked for pain relief like nothing has before, I feel like, in terms of the pain, I can actually get through the day without worry, it’s like being back to my old, pre-diagnosis self. 

The problem is the side effects, and the long term implications of taking this for what is likely to be a lifelong condition, and I’ve just turned 24. I can only use the bathroom with a bunch of laxatives and fibre supplements, my breathing and heartrate are slower, and the osteoporosis and endocrinological risks really do scare me.

"Every inflammation symptom I've had has come back.... fast taper??. TL;DR: W/O a doubt, Suboxone is making me sick - read below, I need to get off this shit fast....

So, as y'all probably noticed - I literally posted a couple of hours ago.  I was off suboxone 100% for a bit of time.  I knew something was up; I'fe been on the fence for a long while... there's something about this drug that doesn't seem ""right"".  First it was the nausea, but that subsided.   Then a lot of itchiness.  That came and went.  All the while my doc has been pushing it and pushing it.  Its good for this, for that.  So, I basically went off.  But I could never make it all the way.  Then, due my docs office not having their shit together, I ended up with tablets, even though he expressly knew I needed strips.  The dude is totally fucked up.  I hate to say it, cause he's also my psychiatrist.

Like I've mentioned innumerable times, in innumerable posts, all across Reddit, I'm dealing with this nightmarish inflammation.  So, after a couple of days without suboxone, I actually felt great.  My head cleared, inflammation went down.... and boom!  Although the euphoria was nice - swollen lymph nodes, lower back pain, cognitive bullshit, and the worst by far is the inflammation in my mouth.  I am seriously enraged.

"As if I needed another reason to stop doing drugs for good.. Just a little rant/story about how I'm definitely done for good.. I have been on Suboxone now 1.5 years (16mg/day).  During that time, I relapsed a ton... Ive gone on a month long ""bender"" and I've gone two weeks between each use just because I couldn't bear say goodbye to my ol' friend Heroin. But, the last 8 months, I haven't had a single fuck-up.  No alcohol, nothing - and I have never felt better. I (and everyone around me) was so proud and I felt it may be truly past me.

But, apparently, that wasn't a good enough excuse for me to stay away forever; I still hadn't gotten rid of that ""burning"" to someday use again.  And my chance finally came.

Earlier in the week, after a fight with my husband over something ridiculously stupid, he left for work (overnight shift) and I messaged my old dealer.  We ended up linking up around 12/12:30am and, after doing a shot, I felt great.  My dealer (who has a pretty big crack addiction) wanted me to drive him to his guys house for some rock, and said we could sit in his house and hang out for a bit.  I thought nothing of it and decided to go - because usually that means free drugs for me if I give him rides places and I obvioiusly wasn't thinking on a sober mind.

So, my dealer's crack dealer's house was super sketchy.  I didn't like it one bit.  I thought it may be me being paranoid from smoking a hit of rock, but something felt off to me.  A guy kept calling the crack dealer's phone and wanted more without any money, and then kept saying he got less than he was supposed to with the money he gave him earlier.  The dealer said he was out and they were basically arguing back and forth almost like boyfriend/girlfriend.  This whole conversation is happening loud as fuck on a phone using speakerphone around 1:00am in a triple-decker apartment.  Twenty minutes later, some guy pounds on the door and it was the guy from the phone call.  He basically demands the guy fronts him more and they argue until crack dealer goes to get it and then phone call guy leaves.  At this point, I was pretty fucking nervous about not wanting to get busted for being so loud, and I didn't want to have to call my husband in the middle of the night for bail money and to explain that i fucked up again, so I told my dude I was leaving.  We left, I took him home and that was that.  It was uncomfortable, I regretted it as usual the next day, and I thought it was over. 

The next day I read the news headline and apparently that phone call guy came back to crack dealer's house at 2:30am with his friend, tied this guy up in his apartment with duct tape, cut him up with a knife, a cleaver, and a broken beer bottle, put a cloth laundry bag over his head, stabbed him some more, stole his safe with his shit and left him for dead.  The cops came and the guy was pronounced dead. 

I literally missed out on being a victim of the ""wrong place at the wrong time"" and literally can't get it out of my mind that if I didn't leave when I did, those guys could have fucking killed me.  I have been thinking about this all day the last two days, and I told my husband about that night because I am so shaken up.  I literally never thought that being a simple user every now and then could put me in a situation of being almost murdered, but I literally missed death by 30-45 minutes.  I would have never seen my kids again, my parents, my husband, nobody.  One angry night where I was without kids I decide to fuck up and do drugs and it could have turned into my kids reading about my murder and learning I was in a drug den.  

I just wanted to share my story because 1) it is literally eating me alive and 2) I hope nobody on here ever encounters this.  But, thankfully this is exactly the wake-up call I needed to never pick up another drug ever ever again.

I immediately got horrendous sharp head pains, not like a normal headache, and extreme nausea. I had to stay in bed all day. Those symptoms continued into yesterday. I’m scared to try spitting again, not sure what happened.

Walgreens doesn’t accept my insurance (Cigna) so it would’ve been $700 out of pocket. My doct told me to use a mom and pop pharmacy so I did and they did accept my insurance but it only got it down to $300. I paid that And I couldn’t use GoodRx because it’s a controlled substance is what the pharmacy told me. I paid the $300 this time but can’t do that every month. Any recommendations? And could I use Goodrx at the Walgreens to get it down from $700 to maybe around $100? I’m hoping somebody else on here ran into a similar issue",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Bupe.me Alabama Question. Sorry if I am late to this, but it just came to and attention last night. My husband has been using Bupe.me for months now. He just logged on there last night, watched the vid, & saw Alabama was mail order only & that they were full, he paid bec he figured he was an existing patient, if he had to get it mail ordered that was fine & of course payment was accepted. He got a receipt via email saying his order was received  & is being processed. I Google Alabama Suboxone Telemedicine & found this Reddit. I see a few of you have had issues not being able to get your meds & a few had no issues getting it. I called Publix where he gets his Rx filled & the pharmacist said they haven't heard of anything regarding Alabama no longer filling telemedicine Suboxone scripts. 
For those of you that had problems getting your prescription filled, what pharmacy were you using? Has anyone else called their pharmacy to check on what they know about Suboxone & telemedicine restrictions? Has anyone in Alabama gotten their meds this month from Bupe.me without any problem? If AL pharmacies won't fill the Rx, can it be called into a pharmacy say like in GA & be picked up from there? Just curious about options.
I am praying he won't have any issues getting his meds & luckily if there is an issue we've got insurance so he can go to a local doc if needed. I know that isn't the case for everyone tho.

"HELP ME PLEASE. I am a 32 year old female living in MN and have been on opiates/methadone/suboxone for the past 15 years..  I have gone through 4, three month bouts of complete sobriety in the past 15 years. Each time I couldn’t bare the PAWs. I could not  eat or sleep, felt like my body weighed a thousand pounds (EXTREME fatigue), FREEZING cold sweats, restless ?!BODY?! syndrome, severe depression, diarrhea, sneeze attacks etc... I felt all of this every single day for 90+ days with no end in sight. It never got any easier, it didn’t get a little bit better each week. I was ready to kill myself but I was too afraid of the unknown so I did the next best thing... I used! 
I’ve been on suboxone for the past 4 years and I am ready to get off of it. I want to be free. Lately I have been noticing more and more severe brain fog and fatigue. 
My boyfriend (of 1 month😬) was on suboxone for 3 years and has been off for 8 months. He has nothing but positive things to say about being off of it.   His new found glory has inspired me to take the leap for myself!  
   I was taking between 2-4 (2mg) strips per day.  I found myself taking another strip half way through the work day to help with the fatigue. 
I am 4 days into my “self taper” and I am taking just barley over two mg a day. I notice my brain function coming back but along with that I am quite anxious and seem to always be thinking that everything feels off (weird and uncomfortable)?!  I also notice the restlessness creeping through my body. 
I am incredibly scared of what is to come. I am seasonally employed and work is about to start again. It is extremely physically demanding work, hauling around 200lb steel panels by hand, lifting 50lb bags of vermiculite for hours on end, etc. 12-14 hour days 5-7 days a week.

"Sporadic withdrawal symptoms after Sublocade cessation?. I finally decided to stop getting my Sublocade shots after being on it for 16 months (and two months of oral Suboxone prior to that). The main reason why I wanted to get on Sublocade was because I heard how much easier it's supposed to be to quit than any oral form of buprenorphine; I knew I'd never willingly taper Suboxone, because I've tried it before, and it's miserable. I'm one week out from when I would have gotten my most recent injection, and for the most part, I feel fine; however, I've been having intermittent symptoms that feel a lot like withdrawal.

Tuesday night, I started getting fidgety, I was yawning nonstop, eyes watering, nose running a little, and I had terrible nausea that only went away after taking promethazine (prescribed to me by the NP at my rehab place, among other comfort meds for coming off the Sublocade). Then this morning, I woke up and I was freezing, and a touch of that nausea was back; normally, I'm a little bit warmer than I'd like in my apartment with the thermostat set to 74, but this morning I was shivering.

"Day 7 without subs.. It’s been a week- LETS GOOO!!. Figured I’d write a little synopsis of my first week off of Suboxone. I was taking 1 mg for around a year. Been on subs for 2. I made the jump from 1 to none- and it hasn’t been that bad.

 Honestly, this subreddit had me in my head. 
It seems like it’s literal hell for a lot of people. 
Sure it hasn’t been the best week ever, but not the worst either. 
Body wise, it’s trying to regulate temperature like normal && that’s probably the most uncomfortable part for me. Feeling hot and cold all at once, it comes in waves. All day- all week. 
Definitely messing with my sleep. Went to bed at 11 pm and woke up at 2 am this morning D: 
But I mean... overall- I’m so fucking happy. I’m so stoked I was able to do this. My birthdays next month, it’s about to be 2020, I’m just ready to fuck shit up for the better and say bye bye to these little orange pills that were changing me in more ways than I realized during that couple of years.
The most noticeable change for me- was having zero sex drive. It was bizarre. I’m a Scorpio chick.. mid 20’s. It felt wrong, I already feel it comin back and I’m here for it && not getting any younger. I don’t know- it was like the suboxone was able to completely disconnect me from the thing they call the sacral chakra. 

Other than that, I alienated myself quite a bit I’d say. I already feel more sociable and less anxious. I’ve been laughing, resting, painting, going for walks, staying up late when I can’t sleep and grinding some good ol GTA. Been eating lots of food too- drinking water & I think Vitamin C has helped significantly. The first couple evenings I made some Kratom tea- seemed to help just a bit but I haven’t needed to since.
I’m just happy. And free.
And I’d encourage anyone who’s trying to move on from Suboxone- to give yourself more credit in realizing how strong we have became over everything we’ve gone through. And I’d have to say the heroin withdrawals were vastly more excruciating than that of Suboxone. You got this. 
Don’t over think it like me.

# I was on an 40 mg OXY period and wanted to get rid of it. I switched to Subotex 4mg which I slowly lower in dose,

# i got to the point where one crumb makes the difference between being really sick or feeling ok.

# At this point I started taking an antidepressant called NARDIL (from the MAOI family) I started with a dose of 15 mg on the second day 30 mg and on the third 45 mg. After a few days I just stopped completely with Subotox and ... boom there is no sense of any withdrawal symptom, it passed completely

# In addition, for the last three days I have also been taking vitamin C at a dose of 3000 mg a day, approximately. But I do not think that is what made the difference. It seems to me that Nardil is the solution",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Propranolol and Withdrawals. So I jumped for the second time off 500mcg Suboxone. This time I did not tell my pharmacist and instead cut off contact with my pharmacy (let my script lapse beforehand) specifically so I couldn't run back to them like a crybaby as soon as I started feeling sick, which I was feeling quite badly now at Day 4.

Mainly anxiety, racing heart, horribly aching legs and terrible lumbago, sweating episodes, feeling cold as a corpse and weak as a kitten, sneezing, yawning, watery eyes, unable to concentrate on anything beyond really simple tasks doing the dishes and walking down the street, exhausted but cannot sleep etc.

So I was searching on the internet on how withdrawal actually works chemically and stumbled on this [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851054/)  which points out that many of the withdrawal symptoms are actually caused not by a sudden lack of endorphins but way down at the primitive brain stem, due to a massive upregulated overabundance of the fundamental neurotransmitter noradrenaline when stopping opiates.

Cut a long story short, I then google noradrenaline antagonists, and up comes the result: ""Two examples of competitive adrenergic **antagonists** are propranolol and phentolamine."" (Propranolol is used to lower blood pressure but also as an anxiolytic as it slows down the heart rate, and inhibits the ""fight or flight"" response.)

I have been taking propranolol as needed for years and have a big supply. I took two (x 40mg), twice my usual dose (it's okay, I used to take three or even four when I had really bad hangovers so I could function without going into total panic) and have to say feel quite a lot better although that could be placebo I guess.

But the Wikipedia article on propranolol does mention it's used in withdrawal, so...

Does anyone know much about propranolol in the context of opiate withdrawal?",0,0,1,0,1,0

"Extremely fatigued. So I've been on subs for a little over a year and a half. Over the last 6 months I started tapering down significantly. I am now taking a sliver of a 2mg strip, less than .5 of a mg a day but I am extremely fatigued all the time. Since I went down from 2, 8 mg strips to just 1, 8mg strip a day I've had the same side effects that haven't seen to go away no matter the dose. I had a really hard time waking up, I had to buy an alarm clock for people with hearing issues and set 20 plus alarms on my phone and most of the time I still missed all the alarms. I would wake up feeling like shit every morning until I took a sub. My doctor's just told me ""that's weird"" but never addressed any of my side affects from subs so I've just lived with it. Since now being on this less than .5 mg a day I've noticed that I can actually wake up to my first alarm which is great for me, I'm very happy about it and I don't feel like absolute garbage in the morning right away, usually start feeling not so great if I don't take it by 11am but nothing like it used to be. My issue is I feel extremely tired all day. My job is manual so I'm always running around at work and I'm so slow now, this has been an ongoing issue on subs for me since I was on 1, 8mg strip daily but It seems to get worse and worse the lower I go to now I'm at the point where I have no motivation to do anything, I feel exhausted and weak all day every single day and I hate it. Ive never been a lazy person, always been motivated, worked towards my goals but I cannot physically do shit about anything anymore, especially these last 6 months. I'm afraid to get completely off subs for fear of feeling like this for a long time but I really wanna be off subs because of feeling like this. See my issue here ?

"I’m having adverse reactions to this medication. Hey y’all, I just recently started suboxone on Wednesday.  I received state funding for it and had to jump off methadone at 65mgs.  I went to a detox for nine days.  I tried to induct 2mgs on the 7th day but  had what they called methadone psychosis.  It was really bad and nearly ended me up in the psych ward.

He used subs for about 3 years, always about 1mg a day until he tapered. He never used any other opiates before that (why did he start suboxone? Still no idea).

It has been a long, pretty awful journey for both of us but I am very hopeful that we’re nearing the end of it… The worst of the symptoms were over after about 6-8 weeks, but after 7 months, he still has AWFUL insomnia. About 50% of the time, he doesn’t feel great, which we agree can be attributed to lack of sleep. He can usually fall asleep, but wakes up constantly and is usually up on the couch by 3am. I don’t think he’s gotten more than 3 consecutive hours of sleep in 7 months. Some nights it’s none. I don’t know how he functions.

He does drink most nights, but not excessively. He sought help from a sleep specialist about 3 months ago and is now prescribed Lunesta, and it honestly doesn’t do much of anything for him. He smokes weed occasionally as well.

"Energy from subs. I hear a lot of people saying they get energy from Suboxone when they take it. And if you ask me (I'm just a regular guy who's had a lot of experience with subs) I'd say that there lays a problem. You should not be getting energy from your medication. The medication is designed to help you establish that energy that you already have/had. If you are getting your energy from the Suboxone itself then you are still not ready to give up the habits that come with taking street drugs. You have to exercise and eat right and take care of yourself. This medication is not designed for you to just take and expect great outcomes. This is what gives Suboxone a stigma and turns people off to the idea. It is also not recommended to stay on the medication for longer than 6 months. In some cases people may need longer. All I'm getting at is do not rely on your Suboxone script to get you motivated to do something. Even washing the dishes or putting your pants on is a struggle when you're withdrawing. But you gotta get yourself up out of that hole, you can do it. Suboxone is just a crutch.",0,0,1,0,0,0

"Cold Turkey Sub WD. Hey , so background I’m a long term prescription user, of many substances , ( every narcotic prescription besides barbs I receive ) . I’m mainly an opioid user . Have used methadone at 270 and cold turkeyed at suffered for over 6 months brutally 2 years ago. Was on subs for 4 months 16mg , and then for 2 weeks took 32mg, and the cold turkeyed with flu and couldn’t take it so that’s why I got on methadone . I now have been on average taking 8-12mg of subs maybe 16mg, for 4 months . I cold turkeyed 6-7 days . I’m trying to get clean and taper from all prescriptions and have done so successfully in past , until I relapsed many months later each time . So far I’m using like roughly 8G of kratom 3x a day and it removed 75%+ symptoms . It’s very hard to sleep, and I’m also bodybuilding and working out 3h daily . So question time .

1) How long approx should wd last , and be specific in acute phase length , and then lesser wd .

"Day 3 post-jump: For those of you who are thinking about doing this- a glimmer of hope.. I know some of you won’t read all of this so I’m putting this at the top- instead of the bottom. 

For those of you who are thinking about putting Suboxone in the rear- 

Get to a place in your life where you no longer feel unable to control yourself. Once you have the strength and willpower to not “go back out”- you might be ready. 

Get your life to a place of stability.  It took 10 years for me to do this. 

If you do decide to jump, I highly recommend the tapering process. Besides the fact that it makes the “jump” easier - it gives you time to mentally prepare for this battle. 

This is, in fact, a mental battle. This is not, however, an impossible feat. Your body will follow your mind, but your mind will fear the body- don’t give into the fear.  Embrace the pain, feel it, revere it, for the pain is bringing you freedom. Freedom from the shackles that Suboxone has ensnared.  

If you believe in you, then you have nothing to fear. It’s never too late and you aren’t alone. 

Good luck, Godspeed. 


P.s I had a couple failed attempts at jumping in the last couple months... I was weak, and caved. 

This time I got rid of everything - no more Suboxone to come to my rescue. 

This helped almost instantly- for it gave me the feeling of absolution, and finality. This time, there is no going back for me. 
————————————————————————


I have been on buprenorphine products for 10 years now. I have had a tremendous fear of getting off them since researching it several years back. 

It manifested in everything I did (the fear). Fear of traveling, dreams of detoxing during incarceration (which I never have been), dreams of having my script stollen.... etc. 

Most days I would wake up with RLS and totally uncomfortable. I wouldn’t dose right away, I would usually wait till the late afternoon. This was because if I didn’t, I’d wake up at 3am with the RLS, sweaty crap- and take an early dose to fall back asleep. 

The minor feelings I would experience in the middle of the night/morning had me afraid of how bad it would get. I could barely make it 12 hours- let alone several days. 

I was fairly stable at 1mg (2mg strips cut in half) for the last year. I had been on 2 then 1.5 then finally 1. I hung out here for a while. 

A couple months ago, I started a simple taper. 1mg .75 .5 .25 then .13 

I had some life stuff going on that I wanted to get past before making the jump so I ended up going back up to .5- then gradually making my way back to ~.13. 

I took my last dose on Saturday. 

I slept well- got a full night sleep. Sunday, I felt the minor symptoms of withdrawal filtering in as the day went on. 

Sunday night, I didn’t sleep but maybe 2 hours- once the sun came up. I was swimming in my bed, pacing in my dark room, took 6 showers! Lol.  

Monday morning, I decided I wasn’t gonna lie around. I decided I was going to redo my back patio with my wife...

My day was Fantastic. Seriously- as the withdrawal crept in more and more...my mind felt sharper, I started feeling more in love with my wife, I started enjoying the tidbits that life provides....

Now we’re here- it’s Tuesday. 

Last night sucked, I got maybe an hour or two of sleep. When I do fall asleep, I quickly wake up in a puddle so 🤷‍♂️- it’s hard to sleep in a wet sweaty bed. 

I got up this morning around 7, did the dishes, made breakfast for myself, and took my pre workout supplement - 

Quick side note: I often drink a very light energy (pre workout) supplement in the morning. It’s called Optimum Nutrition Energy plus Aminos. They make cans you can buy or a powder. This stuff is great. Only 100 mg of caffeine and a huge host of focus inducing amino acids. Some of them are endorphins precursors- I keep wondering if this is keeping me in such good spirits. I highly recommend it- I don’t consume energy drinks, but this stuff is almost too good to be true. 


Once my wife woke up, we decided to work on the patio again...

Now today is much tougher than yesterday. I feel heavy and tired. My body has this Nauseas feeling that I can’t shake- plus the “I can’t sit down and relax because I flop like a fish” syndrome. 

However, guys- I feel fantastic. I mean, I feel terrible but this is not the end of the world. 

If anything, I would rather live like this (minus the complete lack of sleep) than go back to the dull, heavy, mind numbing, irritability causing, motivation sucking, abyss that Suboxone added to my life for a decade. 

Suboxone always ran my life. It was a precursor to every thought I had- and everything I did. 

And it had the effect of making it difficult to enjoy things when I wasn’t in the peak of my dose. 

Movies weren’t as exciting, video games couldn’t keep my attention.. and it was always mood swings and major ups and downs.

Some days I would feel almost “high”.  Other days, I felt worse than before I dosed. Everyday felt sub- life , sub- par. 

I know that I’m not done with this journey. There’s a long road ahead ... 

If I had to gauge things, I would say that tomorrow/ tonight will probably be the worse- or peak- of the physical withdrawal period. 

Because of my super low dose  (which always dissolved in my mouth too quickly and barely made me feel better) before jumping, I went into withdrawals fairly quick- which is what I wanted. I didn’t wanna feel fine because of high plasma levels and long half life- and not start this process till 5 days after cessation. 

I can update if anyone would like. I send you all good vibes and will be receptive to any vibes that I might receive.


Edit:

Here’s my update. 

Night 3 was tough but I was able to fall asleep out of sheer exhaustion and get a few hours eventually.

"Can films lose potency after seal is opened?. So I take half a film in the morning, and other half in evening. There is one half that i left in the seal for a few days. (I folded the top of the seal down to close it and also put it in a ziploc bag.) But when I went to take this half, it was a bit more flimsy and stretchy then they are when you first open them. Normally, a strip is more firm and I can kinda just tear off a piece without  any stretchy excess. But with this, it isn't that firm and it has much excess when torn. Is it just the physical nature of it that altered after being opened? Or is the actual potency of the medicine decreased as well?",0,1,0,0,0,0

"Been on for 7 months & honestly appreciate bup because it gave me a life back. But I'm worried about getting off it.. I kinda don't get the hate / regret around this substance in this community because honestly... Suboxone gave me my life back. Not even the life I had before drug addiction, but a better life that I've built by sheer blood and sweat and the grace of God. Before Subs I was constantly in withdrawal and so literally dysfunctional in every aspect of my life -- for example, couldn't work a six hour shift, et cetera. I don't want to go back to that obviously. I was using heroin and fentanyl occasionally, but actually mostly Rx like oxymorphone, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and a lot of opium poppies. Admittedly, my main problem was methamphetamine. Anyway, but now I've been sober for *longer than I was using.* I was only in the hell of hard drug addiction for around six months. People gave so much shit for that at rehab and in meetings, but honestly, oh boy, I wouldn't even wish that they could have seen me during those times... Basically what I am asking is really: will very slowly tapering off Suboxone, given that I have a consistent prescribed access that is unlikely to change, be that problematic if I am careful? I guess I am just worried about totally losing all control and descending to full blown heroin addiction from a taper or something idk. I don't know if that is realistic or not. Perhaps you all can provide insight? I would say knowing myself, I would likely just get kratom or poppies in the absolute worst case that I am abruptly cut from Suboxone lol, given that I would do anything NOT to return to real, fierce addiction.",0,0,1,1,1,0

I took my last dose of CW fent of a two day binge ( was fully induced on subs before) about noon tuesday and was in hell by 2-130am (about 12 hours after last dose). I waited more till 4am (15 hours since last dose) and took a half mg strip then another half mg strip an hour later.

Im took two small shots about 6 hours apart today (8am and 3pm). So now the last dose clock starts again at 3pm today.

Im terrified of PWD so even though I only did two days of pure fent after almost a week on 4mg/day sub i only take .5mg at a time then go up to 1mg, then maybe 2mg by the 18hr mark.

Just trying to get through the day on subs only. No DOC starting today.. I am on day 4 of the Bernese method for switching from fettydope to subs. I have a couple posts under this sub for how I went about doing it. I was able to induce 4mg of subs over the last 3 days while fighting off PWD with small shots of work. I don't have any dope left and although I can go and get some I do not want to anymore. I don't feel shitty or like I'm in withdrawal even. My pupils are pretty pinned so there is some sort of opiate in me that's working. My last shot of fettdope was yday at about 11pm. So clearly that is probably still in me along with the sub. Should I just wait to take a piece of sub until I start feeling shitty? Do I just take it now and see if I go into PWD? If I do tho that almost guarantees me getting more work to get out of it.

"Argument about buprenorphine w/ my mom.. Hey guys! 👋 

My mom is on subutex and I’m on suboxone. 
She was recently on Suboxone but they switched her over to subutex because she has cirrhosis of the liver.
Long story short, she thinks subutex is COMPLETELY different than suboxone. My whole point to her is it’s buprenorphine which is the SAME Ingredient in both suboxone and subutex, only thing is suboxone has naloxone and subutex doesn’t have that. She thinks naloxone is the only only opiate blocker and buprenorphine doesn’t block opiates. 

She also thinks coming off subutex will
Be easier than coming off of suboxone because of it not “blocking opiates” and that if she needed pain medicine she’d feel it 100% because she takes Subutex 😂 

My whole point to her is that they are basically the same just the naloxone will make you go into precipitated withdrawals if you abuse it by snorting or IV usage etc. I could be completely wrong and have no clue about any of this. She thinks buprenorphine won’t block other opiates from working like suboxone does? Would love a break down for her to read or understand, or for me to understand if I’m wrong about it.

 I've been on suboxone for 2 1/2 years. I started on moderate dose then my Dr upped me to help with longterm pain. Its been a godsend with pain.  I'd never tried street drugs, just prescribed narcotics which got out of hand as I kept trying to cover up pain. **I was on MS Contin (extended release morphine for 8+ years & dabbled in other prescription narcotics when my dose wasn't enough so total of about 20 years of constant use)**
But my Dr retired & new Dr wants me back to ""standard dose"". He dropped me 8mg within 30 days and I feel almost on verge of constant withdrawal. I don't know if its my mind playing tricks on me or the actual decrease.

"Am I the only one who has issues with GoodRX?. I don't have insurance at the moment hence why I use GoodRX. Here's a few problems I've ran into.

1— GoodRX Gold is a complete scam. Do not pay for it (for subs anyway) They advertise that you can save up to 90% a month for a $5.99 monthly subscription fee. After you enroll and pay the membership fee the prescription actually ends up costing MORE than it would with the GoodRX Standard coupon. Sometimes up to $25 more. For example the standard coupon was $108 last month and I was charged $116 for ""Gold"" *can show evidence of this if anyone's curious*

2— CVS continuously inputs the wrong codes charging me an arbitrary amount. At least every other month. I present the STANDARD coupon for the afformentioned reason and they will still ring it up as Gold and it will cost more. As a recovering addict it goes without surprise that finances are not my strongest skill and it's quite disheartening to have budgeted X amount to be charged whatever the CVS technician decides they want to charge me that month.

"I really screwed up.. I've been using Subs for a little over 2 years now. I'm currently at 3mg and have been working on a taper, well this week I accidentally left my bottle in a rest stop while I was traveling. When I finally realized it It was WAY too late. I had 2 days left (this was last week) so I figured it's almost the 1st when I usually renew my monthly script anyway so I told my doc I had left my meds but I told him that they were gonna be sent to me through the mail. I didn't want to have to admit I'm a complete fucking idiot and left my shit in some podunk bathroom in the rocky mountains. So I thought since we were so close to the normal time I renew he would just renew my script and send it a little early (he's done this before) but instead he sent me a week's worth for a bridge so I just took that and figured I'd stretch it. Which I have, it's helped my taper BUT I ran out today took about .25 MG and my other script is being sent in the mail and won't be here until next fucking week.

"Why do some people think there is not a ""blocking"" effect from buprenorphine under 2mg?. I've heard this thrown around quite a bit. A lot of people say suboxone doesn't even have an opiate blocking effect at 2mg and under. I've even heard some people say that number is 4mg which I know for a *fact* is not true. 

What are people's reasons for thinking this? Do you think it's because *they* specifically were able to get high after using just 2mg? Because I know even at 2mg, I would have a diminished effect from my dope when I did it, and definitely really diminished effect from lortabs/percocets. Currently I'm at about 1 or usually 2mg of suboxone a day, sometimes 3. So I'm like right at that apparent ""no blocking"" zone lol why do people think suboxone doesn't block opiates at 2mg and under? Because in my experience it definitely does, just not as much. 

On another note, what do you think the MME of buprenorphine is? Most sources I've seen say either 30 or 40 MME; that 1mg of parenteral buprenorphine (which I guess means IV/IM or subcutaneous/subdermal) is equal to about 40mg of oral morphine. And I take them sublingually, so I think that's like 50% bioavailability or something, right? So 1mg of suboxone would be equal to about 30-40mg morphine/hydrocodone or 20-30mg of oxycodone. Does this sound about right to you guys? I'm thinking of just getting back on a short acting weak opiate like lortabs for the end of my suboxone taper, since it's easier to kick hydros than it is subs ime.

Needless to say it has saved my life. I only take 2-4mg/day now and some days will forget to even take it.

"Question (on my throwaway account) about suboxone and methadone. I hope anyone can shed some light on any possibilities… 

Right now I’m on 105mg of methadone and need to switch to Suboxone ASAP… more because I want to than need to… methadone has caused me to go from 125lbs to 215lbs, I gained 60lbs in the first month of methadone alone… I used to use suboxone, I did for a two year period on 8mg and it was great, no weight issues or any issues at all. Now with methadone I’m constantly sweating, fatigued, almost diabetic, my liver is getting fucked… idk how much is the medicine and how much is me but I know I wasn’t this bad on suboxone AT ALL. And I’m looking for options to switch. 

First way is to stop the methadone and wait some days (ten?) to induce in sub but this way is horrifically painful

Second is tapering to 30mg and switching by waiting 3 days instead. But even going down 4mg has me suffering on methadone. That never happened to me while tapering sub

Third way I’ve considered is something called the “azar method” and another one called the “Stanciu method” which involve using medical grade fentanyl as a bridge to Suboxone. Basically stopping methadone, starting fent, staying on it for some time then a normal suboxone induction is done.

Fourth way is doing the above but by myself with illicit opiates (hoping it isn’t street fent because it won’t work) since it’s so hard to find any doctor willing to help me with that in the US

IDK what do you guys think?… I’m really lost and depresssed, I can’t take much more of this…

Instead i work a job i hate and i live in someone elses house and i rarely socialise but its okay because i have the subs to look forward to. Every week i tell myself ill make changes next week and i never do. When i really do think about coming off the subs and everything it will take it scares the shit out of me. I cant keep living like this its killing me and if i do feel ok its because im high on subs or about to get high on subs.

"Suboxone- an accidental good from Big Pharma?. I'll cut to chase. I have been alcoholic since 13. Drug addict since late teens and I have destroyed my life over and over again. I am now 33 and recently divorced- due to my use. I have tried staying sober for a few years to no avail. Tried kratom maintenance- that shit backfired. Mainly because all strains are different and unreliable, the duration is short and if you don't have a reliable vendor you're fucked. Nothing worked.

So what’s true? I get way better chronic pain results at lower dosages of Suboxone than I’m prescribed.

I was such a skeptic and couldn’t wrap my head around the concept of “less is more” with this drug. 
I’m glad I “listened” to those who know better than I and pulled my head out of my ass. I’m also going to ask my doctor to reduce the dosage as enough time has transpired to know it’s working. 

I have a mild OUD according to my doc, hence starting on Suboxone. The initial plan was to temporarily utilize the drug while looking for other means of relief for chronic pain.  Then came the  surprise… marked pain relief with Buprenorphine. It’s far better than the full agonists I was prescribed for many years. But truth is, if it weren’t for Buprenorphine, I’d run somewhere for relief and I’d hate to see where that could take me.

"Down to .5mg in taper. Down to .5mg in my taper. As usual the night/day I switch the dose is the worst. No sleep, RLs despite lorazepam and clonidine and melatonin. Anyway I’ve seen a lot of people say on here that the taper doesn’t get hard until 1mg and below. What’s crazy is that my Dr gave me a taper schedule but didn’t tell me to go this low, I’m way ahead of his schedule (been ahead the whole time with no issues)and going lower bc I’m not comfortable jumping at 1mg.  Just wondering tho…. .5 seems the worst I’ve felt so far, I guess it’s just not able to produce a long half life?? Idk. I’m mad tired and I’ll still have to force myself to exercise today bc that is my only hope to feel better. Just in case anyone asks I’ve been on subutex 9 years methadone 3 years begore that .

"Subs or kratom to get off fake percs ?. I take about 25 fake percs a day so about 750mg i know it sounds crazy but my addiction escalated very quickly it went from one perc a day to ten n then to twenty five shortly after, I am sick of this shit so im ready to take the next step but the withdraws are literally horrible…. I got prescribed suboxone but I am afraid i will just get addicted to those and have to deal with this all over again. I plan to take subs just long enough for my physical withdraws to stop and then quit them as well. My doctor told me to have kratom on standby as well, so i’m wondering if kratom is better and if it will do the job instead of the subs apparently it’s not as good as subs but i wanted to get some other insight from other people. So what do y’all think is smarter for me to do…. should i take the subs n just use kratom the first few days until the fentanyl gets out of my system to help the withdraws not be as bad or should i take kratom n just say fuck the subs ?

Occasionally, I'll miss a dose and be fine for that day, but I can't miss it two days in a row or I'll start feeling sick.

I've read a few times that methadone is much better for pain management, so I'm wondering if anybody here has any experience with a similar situation.

"Can using tramadol for ending my suboxone withdrawl a good idea?. Hello,  


I was very addicted to tramadol 3/4 years ago, at the end I was taking 450 drops/daily wich was close to the lethal dose I think. Then I went to see a doctor and I started taking suboxone (24mg/daily) I took this amount for about 1 year and then at the end of the last year I started reducing it and today I'm almost close to the end (taking about 0.350/0.400 mg daily).  


I'm having two problems right now : the first one is that it's been about 6 weeks that I can't do workout anymore,( I have an allergy problem, maybe histamine intolerence and doing workout is making me sicker)and the workout was helping me enormously to endure the pain of the withdrawl.  


Second problem is that it's getting impossible to control the amount that I'm taking, even with 2mg of sub it's very hard to cut it with accurency so my daily intake is getting very randoom. Worst my drog store are out of suboxone since few week so I only have 8mg sub remaining wich is even harden to cut with accurency.  


I was thinking that one of the solution could be switching from sub to tramadole, with tramadole (drops) I can control my intake with a huge accurency.   


Do you think it's a good idea? If I do that I should first spend about 48hours without taking sub before taking tramadol right? Also what is the equivalent of 0.350/0.400 mg of sub in tramadol?   


My last option would be to use swith to kratom instead of tramadol but I'm not 100% sure that is the best idea.",0,1,1,0,1,0

"my feet/legs are numb and i’ve lost the ability to walk and stand. i don’t think this has to do with suboxone but thought i’d put it in here in case. i’m an addict and my DOC’s were dilaudid, oxycontin, percocet, things like that. some light xanax usage.

"Pharmacies are cracking down on pick up rules.. I’ve been on this medication for nearly 2 years after I completed an in patient week long detox. From the very beginning, my pharmacy always let me pick it up 2 days early, which worked because of my work schedule & stuff. Last month, all of a sudden my pharmacy decided to make me wait an extra day & told me they would release it one day early only & that’s how it’s always been. I politely told them that was incorrect because I have my refill history that proves that every month for about a year I’ve been getting it every 28 days, they refute me telling me I’m wrong. I picked it up the next day last month without an issue. This month however, my doctor specifically requested I be allowed to pick it up today because my son is having surgery & I’m unable to pick it up the next 2-3 days due to working 12-14 hr days. I contacted my pharmacy, first off they were rude & said absolutely under no circumstances would they fill it today, even if it means I run out before I could pick up. They again tell me this is the way it’s always been & she told me I don’t know how to count. I have no one to pick my meds up for me, so now I have to choose whether I skip work tomorrow to be able to get my medication or suffer.

"Snorting Subs Question/Experience. So I know this has already been answered, yes you can snort suboxone, but that's not my question. Let me just say that I am not prescribed it and am not an addict, I simply just wanted to experience the recreational aspect of subs, as i dont want to try the actual drug, with subs being used to basically ween the user off, as far as i know. I used to snort Percocet 10mg pills and was spending close to 400 a month on them, but then just stopped one day, no withdrawal or anything. Recently I snorted about 25 Vicodens over the course of 5 days, they made me more tired and eventually once they wore off I got really nauseous and didn't wanna move, but I feel fine after I sleep. 

So anyway, I've done subs once, like 6 months ago. I was told by my friend that they are much stronger than percocet, and that a little piece crushed up should be good for me. So when I got home, I took a knife and cut off not even a quarter of the pill, probably idk, 1/12th or something, like the size of a grain of rice, crushed it up, and railed it. I don't remember a lot from the high but the weird part I am here to question is, I went to lay down as I was tired. However, soon after I kinda fell asleep but wasn't actually sleeping? I specifically remember my eyes being half open and me being aware I was awake, but also in a position like I was sleeping and I didn't move for like 3 hours. 

I was wondering if this is a bad effect or maybe I did too much at once? I was looking for an effect similar to percocet which used to give me a really calm feeling but also a super focused head high, followed by eventually passing out from being tired, similar to how I felt when I was taking oxycodone when I was in the hospital with cancer.",0,0,1,1,0,0

I’ve also posted this in the Methadone group but basically, I’m a thirty something English male who lives in South Australia. Came over to SA a year ago from the UK and I’ve really struggled to get any opiates both legally and illegally which has added to my anxiety. Been prescribed minimal tramadol for a bad back and I’ve been using PST & scoring Rikodeine where I can, which barely does anything.   

Tried countless times to quit and just need help managing my demons. Hoping my GP/Dr helps me out and gets me on a subs or Methadone program. 

Would love to hear anyone else’s experiences with telling their doctor about their addiction.   

Super nervous! I’ll report back on how it goes, wish me luck.

EDIT: For everyone asking, I was on roughly 500-600mg of tramadol a day when I was in England (which is dangerous given the seizures that can arise from it). And since I’ve arrived in Australia, I’ve been on around 400-500mg of dihydrocodiene a day & roughly 150-200mg of tramadol on top of that.

"home delivery of meds. So I posted to a comment about this but I wanted to start a new thread. Has anyone else thought about home delivery of MATe g Suboxone? There is a huge demand for this and I'm curious as to why more doctors /providers have not brought on their own dispensaries/ pharmacies so they could provide home delivery for the appropriate patient of course (when you're first starting out you may need a little bit more accountability and structure.) Not to mention we have all these problems with the pharmacies and pharmacist. You could still meet with your doctor every 3 weeks and then that would allow the 4th week for delivery. The doctors could control the delivery date by utilizing FedEx ups and I'm sure we as patients would be more than happy to absorb the shipping cost in exchange for Reliable delivery. I don't know about y'all but I have had horror stories with pharmacist and I've even had to go into withdrawal because I couldn't get the medication in time. In my previous comment to a post I explained where a Walgreens pharmacist yelled out to me in the waiting area ""your drugs are ready"". He had a smirk on his face and everyone heard him say this. Granted the other customers may not have made the connection but I certainly knew what he was saying. Has anyone else thought about this home delivery idea? Obviously the doctor / provider would need to have a DEA number in the state in which the medication was going to be delivered.

Precipitated withdrawal. Hey everybody my friend just took 2mg of suboxone way to early at like the 18 hour mark. Went through 12 hours of hell went to the hospital and everything. He’s still feeling terrible and just asked me if it’s safe to take more suboxone now? Should he wait another say 24 hours before trying to induct again? Fortunately haven’t gone through precipitated withdrawal so I don’t have any good advice for him. Should he try like .5mg see how he feels? I just don’t wanna say yeah take more and make it worse for him. Thanks everybody on here always a great help!,0,1,1,0,0,0
"Does Anyone Else Do This. Hey Everyone,

Sucks I'm not making my goal of being off these damn things by Dec 31st. Been stuck at 2mg per day for months now. However since my last refill I've dose the first day then I try to go as long as I can before I feel cruddy before dosing again. At first I wouldn't even skip a full day, but the last time I dosed 2mg was Friday at 730pm. So far made it past around 28hrs and am going to try to skip the rest of the weekend and dose Monday. Obviously if I feel awful enough I'll dose, but so far made it 29hrs almost. So to my question: Does anyone else go about dosing like this? Also, if you do dose like this do you try to go as long as possible or until you feel wd kicking in?

worried about respiratory depression.. As a recently ex heroin/fentanyl addict it sounds stupid I know.  But I worried about it then as well. I'd wait until I didn't really feel the H much anymore to go to bed. Usually an hour and a half or 2. And I'd still kick and jerk like crazy I honestly believe I had low o2 levels every time I went to sleep. Can't really stay up longer than the sub is active so I've been sleeping on it and my mom says I barely snore now and I get much much better rest I've noticed  the past 3 nights.  But I'm still terrified of not waking up when I go to bed. My doctor has me taking one dose when I wake up one in the evening and once more before bed to get me threw the night. Total of 24mgs of suboxone every day. Because I'm just recently sober and that's how much it takes for me right now. Starting tomorrow tho it'll be 8mg when I get up 4mg around 3-4pm and another 4 around 10-11pm. I'm obviously much safer now that I'm off dope. And I don't do that jerking shit anymore as I fall asleep.  But still I'm worried. What's your alls opinion? Just my ocd/anxiety getting the best of me?

"Started Subs after rehab. So I recently came home from rehab about 4 weeks ago from shooting Fetty. I made it to two weeks before my cravings got really bad. So I bought a 8mh strip off the streets and it lasted me a week. They go for $30 a strip where I'm at and I was not about to pay that, so I ended up finding Ophelia. Which they take my insurance, thank God, so everything is free. They have me on 16mg a day, I've been on subs for 3 weeks now. 
I get cravings a little here and there but I stray away cause I don't want precipitative WD, which that helps keep me in check. 

I've been getting the yellow pack generic brand this whole time and I believe it's the source behind my ankles and feet swelling up. Anyone else have this issue?  I switched to the brand name today, so we'll see if there's a difference. 

I'm also noticing all the stigma around subs and how NA is basically saying im not clean while im in this. But my thing is that NA says not to take anything that alters your thoughts/emotions, which subs don't even do. If anything they just make me feel actually normal for once. I don't want to be on subs long but definitely until I hit 6 months cause I was told in rehab that fetanyl hits you bad at 6 months cause of some half life.

"Made another vlog, I decided to drop the liquid taper as it wasn’t working for me and go back to regular dosing- here’s what I’ve learned.. So this has been a roller coaster of a few days guys and after my post yesterday, and crying in the vlog I made, I decided to make a decision and go back to what I knew. I decided to go back to regular tapering with the subutext pills and weighing them out and putting them under my tongue the old way. (Not doing the alcohol/water taper)

Here’s the vlog about switching back to regular dosing, it’s very short : https://youtu.be/AdsDIdHHacg

Here’s what I talk about in it (but here with a lot more depth, I didn’t cover all I wanted) 

Basically six days ago I tried to switch to a liquid taper with the alcohol- I went down from 0.60 to 0.52, such a low drop that I didn’t think I would have ANY problems bc of the higher bioavailability and what people said : increased absorption rate. But after careful consideration and after a lot of thought and obsessing and taking my regular dose this morning 0.52 with the pill under my tongue: I can tell you a couple things. 

First I believe that I was able to take my pill and put it in my mouth and fall asleep- pretty easy as I put my pill by my bed- this makes me have my mouth dry, sleep through any slight wd, and wake up feeling like I was good. But with the volumetric dosing I had to wake up- go pull the water out put it in my mouth and try not to spill any and keep my head back bc water/alcohol moves around a lot (I also could not fall back asleep). It’s hard to keep the water and alcohol one place in my mouth- and even if I held it fourty five minutes like I do taking it the old way-  I still felt significant withdrawals. I also could  not fall back asleep bc the wd were so bad- and it would take about 2 hours to kick in! I never felt this the regular way of taking it. I also would accumulate a lot of saliva bc of the alcohol- it just would start pooling the minute I put it under my tongue. I changed back to regular dosing and I really felt my dose this morning- even though I did not change it from my liquid dose. Which means I wasn’t absorbing the liquid dose as well. I think bc of how much suffering I was having, that I was not absorbing any where near the 0.52 mg because of the saliva that would happen right away bc of the alcohol. Before I knew any of this I also wondered if it was the liquid taper causing me to have to go to split dosing- I was able to dose once before and never had any problems in the afternoon like I was on the liquid taper. I also now believe that this was from the fact that I was not absorbing it like I was the pill.  I also believe that I will have to move down from this dose Tommorow (taking it the regular way)  as it’s too much! 

This has all really thrown me for a loop, I went into this believing that I would be able to absorb it in 10 minutes, that I would feel the full dose and it would be better than taking it the old way. But for me that was wrong, I also want to make sure that i don’t put anyone off it. I think it can be a great tool- and I wonder if doing it with just water would have been a much better way. I’m not sure, but I wasn’t willing to keep going the way I was or even willing to try it with just water. I was so upset, so on edge, withdrawing so much. And I couldn’t figure it out and I kept trying to wait it out. I’m glad I didn’t wait it out. I made it six days and I’m happy I tried it. But some things work for some people and other things don’t. 

But I’ve learned a lot and I am willing at this point to taper the way I had been- I also had not had significant withdrawals in any of my previous tapers doing it the regular way. 

Anyways I want to thank you guys for commenting and being so supportive about my post yesterday, it really helped me a lot. You guys have been so important to the success I’ve had so far, and I couldn’t have done any of it without you!",0,1,1,0,1,0

"Anyone consider Narcaning themselves?. Bare with me

I’m on day 2 of a dope withdrawal using Suboxone. I’m prescribed 24 mgs a day, I’m guessing for my induction period.  They are not working. I’m coming off a huge habit of about 3-4 bundles a day. My doctor did say there’s a chance it may not work as well considering the heights I’ve reached in my long illustrious career and I might have to try methadone. I chose the sub route as I didn’t want to be chained to another dealer. Well, I’m still in full blown withdrawal and I’m one hundred percent it’s not percipitated withdrawals. We did a slow introduction dose (2 in fact) and I was already in full withdrawal mode. Not to mention I had PW, once, last year, as I’m sure that stuff had fent in it. So, unbeknownst to me, I needed more time before taking the sub. This is run of the mill ( if there is such a thing) dope withdrawals. What I’m also positive of is this is simply the Bupe plugging my receptors, but not fully activating them like dope would, but they’re all full (wasted money to confirm) 
So I’m stuck in withdrawal hell. So I was considering narcaning myself to get this cement out and dope in until I see the doc again Friday? 
Any thoughts and yes I know what I’m in for, as I’ve been through it, but as I understand it, it wears off faster then basically waiting for the subs to wear off.

"Question / Experience. Okay.. so bear with me here. I'm a mobile user and my initial post was confusingly worded.. massively edited for clarity

I'm a long time heavy user now, about a decade. I finally got clean about a year ago just to fall back into it. However I was driving back and forth to New Orleans (a multiple hour drive) to get my dope. So sometimes I would run out and have to go to work with no dope while sick. So after that happened once I said fuck that and got some subs. 

So waking up one morning, after having been bingeing on dope and finally running out- I wouldn't be feeling terrible just yet, just mildly dope sick, I made a SHOT out of a piece of a strip, about an eighth to a quarter. I mixed it up and shot it (IV) and about a minute later I got the precipitated withdrawals. However that went away within 5 to 10 minutes after. 

I would continue this practice only when I had run out of drugs and needed to be held over. Doing a sub shot when I was beginning to feel sick (not full blown sick, mind you, at all) and experiencing the same thing. A minute after a small IV shot I would get TERRIBLY sick, gagging, sweating, shaking, the works... But I would just wait it out and ten minutes later I would be fine for about 24 hours. 

Is this common? Have any of you done this?

My point is that most people say you have to wait until you're in complete WD before taking subs or else you risk the Precipitated WD's- (which EVERY person I know says lasts for hours) And especially because I'm shooting the subs which activate the Precipitated WD's. But why does it only last a few minutes for me? Then I'm fine. It doesn't seem like much of a deterrent to people who wanna shoot it. I'm asking because I can't find this info anywhere else online. 

Anyways, slightly unrelated note:

I'm currently on methdaone (worked my way down to only 18mgs a day now!) And I am planning to keep coming down until I'm on 2mg. Then I want to switch to hopefully tabs or percs for a week then come off of those. Possibly with extremely small doses of suboxone as I've done that before to skip withdrawal after a heroin taper.

"how to transition from suboxone to Kratom safely?. So, my buddy is prescribed 16mg of suboxone daily.  He really only takes 8mg daily.  What would be the best way to transition without risk of precipitated WD.  Ween down to 2mg, then abruptly stop taking for how long before being able to safely transition.   From experience,  the Kratom type I'd recommend (I'm no kratom expert) would be Red Mang Dae.  I've personally used it from opiate WD and they stopped completely and I was normal.   Also, an ex weened down gradually off high dose of Methadone, then at 35mg she stopped completely.   3 1/2-4 days later she was suffering bad.  I bought either 7lbs or 7 Kilos of Kratom & the Red Mang Dae & a Red Dragon alleviated all symptoms completely.   Now subs are different bc of the  Naloxone, so would it be best to ween  to 2mg then wait a certain amount of days, then take Kratom,  or would it be best for him to just stop taking his  8mg abruptly & when he starts getting sick then take the Kratom.

When I first saw the doctor, I explained that I'd been buying subs and once zubsolv off the street for a bit. He gave me the choice between the two, and I chose zubsolv because I remember it tasted better and if I wanted to switch to subs, I could.

Now, my PA won't switch me back to Suboxone even though I told her the Zubsolv doesn't seem to work for anything besides keeping my withdrawals at bay -- I was an addict because I had horrible chronic back pain, and went on subs because it helped that too-- but the zubsolv doesn't help the pain at all. She told me there's ""no medical reason"" to switch me.

Secondly, I had always kept a sub strip in my mouth for 5-10 minutes before swallowing so I did pretty much the same with zubsolv. The PA told me I was ""doing it wrong"", that subs need to stay for 30 minutes and zubs for 20. Subs are fairly easy to keep in my mouth longer, as I put it on the inside of my cheek. But zubsolv is really hard to keep there under my tongue for 20 full minutes. Does it really make a difference?",0,1,1,0,0,0

hey guys. im a mod over at r/opiates and was rewriting our sidebar's Suboxone FAQ. i figured id share this resource with you guys too

XPOST:
Im working on revamping our suboxone faq in sidebar, but in the meantime I was inspired by a great informative post earlier on suboxone and wanted to write up another post with more information since these questions are constantly asked here and there is constant misinformation being spread. After a bit more editing, this will be added to the sidebar and available for reference :)

Bupe/sub defined; its forms & doses; its purposes
-What is suboxone? Suboxone is a brand name drug manufactured by Reckitt-Benckiser that is a combination of buprnorphine and naloxone in a 4:1 ratio. It is a moderately powerful semi-synthetic opioid that is most commonly used as a maintenance medication for people that are opioid dependent; however it can also be used for a couple other purposes that will be covered in this guide. It is the preferred medication for maintenance treatment because it is only a partial agonist and doesn't have all the awesome euphoria associated with most opioids. It also has a ceiling effect that keeps people from just upping the dose through the rough and getting high like with methadone.

-What forms and doses does it typically come in?

Suboxone strips(or generic strips): buprenorphine / naloxone 4:1.

Subutex: buprenorphine

Generic tablets: buprenorphine/ naloxone 4:1

DOSES AVAILABLE: 2mg, 4mg, 8mg, 12mg

*there also is Zubsolv, which is another bupe/nalox combo but with an additive for better absorption resulting in higher bioavailability.

-What is it prescribed for & Who Can Prescribe it?

Most commonly used in addiction treatment as a form of MAT (medication assisted treatment) for those opioid dependent. It blocks full agonists which discourages use/relapse while taking it, and is known to help many people with cravings.

It is sometimes used in Pain Management, and while some do not find it to be effective in treating their chronic pain many people do find success with this treatment and benefit from bupe's good analgesic properties, which are often found best effective for pain in low doses under 1mg.

Less common, bupe is being used in some studies and medical facilities off-label in managing depression in patients with treatment resistant depression.

Buprenorphine can only be prescribed by certain physicians, requiring a special course & license in order to be able to prescribe it. It is typically prescribed by addiction specialists, pain management doctors, sometimes psychiatrists.

Inducing bupe; PWDs
-Buprenorphine needs to be induced when a person is already in moderate to severe withdrawal. There is no set amount of time after your last opioid dose that you must wait, as it really relies on your symptoms, but waiting at least 24 hours is a pretty standard and safe way to go. However, you should use the COWS scale to rank your withdrawal symptoms when determining the right time to begin induction.

-If you induce bupe too soon, you can very likely experience precipitated withdrawals (PWDs). This occurs when you still have full agonist opioids on your receptors, take your bupe too soon, which then rips the full agonist off very uncomfortably and throws you into a horrible, magnified withdrawal that is worse than typical WD and can last hours.

-To induce bupe once you've determined you're ready and safe to do so, while many doctors (who drastically overprescribe) tell you to take an entire 8mg as your first dose... in my extended experience and extensive research over the years, i've found that it's best to begin with a small amount and work your way up higher as needed. A good start would be taking 1-2mg, waiting an hour to gauge how you feel before adding on, and then if your symptoms still have not subsided induce another 1-2mg every hour until you are reasonably comfortable. Its common to begin your sub use on higher doses such as 8-16mg; however it is often unnecessary to go that high and its better to get by on as low of a dose as you can stabilize on.

The Bernese Method of Induction
For those that struggle to wait the 24+ hour period of sickness before they can take sub, there is a method available that if done right will make the transition much smoother, called the Bernese Method.

This method is the use of bupe alongside your full agonist opiate for a short period, taking the bupe in micro amounts that gradually increase while your dose of full agonist gradually decreases. What this does is allows bupe to start binding to your receptors and creating a buildup, but due to the low amount and the full agonist taken on top of it you wont experience PWD while this happens. As your system begins to have bupe built up on your receptors, it makes dropping off your full agonist and all the way onto a higher dose of the bupe essentially painless.

An example of how this is done: In this example we're looking at a 5 day schedule, with bupe increasing in very small amounts while your full agonist will decrease by 20% each day. For this example lets assume your habit is 1gram of heroin per day. Here is how you could use the Bernese Method to induce bupe:

*Starting point: 1g dope, 0mg bupe

*Day 1: 0.125mg bupe, then 0.8g dope

*Day 2: 0.25mg bupe, then 0.6g dope

*Day 3: 0.5mg bupe, then 0.4g dope

*Day 4: 0.75mg bupe, then 0.2g dope

*Day 5: 1mg bupe, 0 dope. Now that you've dropped your full agonist, you can begin increasing your bupe using the same method described above for regular induction, until you reach a dose you can stabilize on.

Getting on bupe: cost; how to get a prescription;
-How to get a prescription: you can use suboxone.com or google suboxone doctors in your area. or if you have insurance you can call your provider and ask for doctors that way. Once you've found a doctor, you'll go in for an intake. Expect a UA at this, and every, visit. You must fail for opiates or buprenorphine generally in order to be scripted. As long as you go to your intake, drop a dirty UA, and pay - you should be walking out the door that day with your script. Some places will make you go weekly or biweekly at first or if you come in with dirty UAs. Some places will script you a month at a time as long as you pass your UA. It varies a little bit for each person, but many times you will start out scripted 8-16mg a day.

-Cost: This varies quite a bit, based on whether or not you have insurance and on your location. Many places will still charge a cash copay too even if you do have insurance coverage, but your script should be mostly (if not fully) covered by the insurance.

Typically an intake visit runs from around 200-350$, and then goes down in future visits to a lesser amount ranging from around 100-200$.

Without insurance, you can get the generic bupe tablets for like $3ea with coupon that is available online.

-Bonus: street cost: Some of us cannot afford to obtain a script the legitimate way, or just cant have access for whatever reason. But good thing thanks to overprescribing, the streets are flooded with subs in many areas. The price varies state to state, going from $10ea at minimum to $25ea at maximum. $15 or so could be considered the average.

Getting off bupe: proper tapering; disputing horror stories;
-Getting off bupe can be difficult, but it does NOT at all have to be what people make it out to be. If you do it the right way!

-Disputing horror stories: People often say how horrible it is to come off subs, how its worse than dope, how its not worth it to go on them at all due to the detox, that its hell etc. However, its very likely that 95% of these people did not do a proper taper. They either jumped too high, tapered too fast, or didnt taper at all and cold turkeyed it. If you do any of those things, you will have a horror story.

-Properly Tapering: Tapering off subs can be a process that takes a bit of time, patience, and committment. Its common for the taper process to take weeks or months. To find out how to taper off, ask your doctor, google the helpmegetoffdrugs suboxone taper, OR i (u/chasingd0pamine) write custom tapers for redditors so you can shoot me a message.

Routes of Administration (ROAs) & their Bioavailabilities
*The prescribed way to take it is sublingually - dissolved under the tongue. but there are other ways, which do have higher bioavailabilities. I am not suggesting anyone abuse their meds, but if you can cut your dose by using another ROA you can cut your cost and make this more affordable.

Sublingual: 30%

Intranasal: 45%

Rectal: 54%

IV: 100%

Breaking through bupe/using after bupe; recreational value
-It is extremely dangerous to try and break through your dose to get high. If you are going to use, it really depends on your bupe dose but youll typically need to wait 24-48 hours in order to get high. sometimes more if you are on a high dose of sub and have been on it for a while.

-Recreational Value: Bupe can have a recreational value to some users, but really just to those who have a very low tolerance. Remember that less is more when taking it to get high, and that it is very potent and sometimes makes people sick when they are trying to get high off it.

Suboxone maintenance: benefits; clean vs not
-Benefits: Choosing bupe is not for everyone, but it saves many lives. It is great for chronic relapsers, for those who need a stepping stone while rebuilding their lives and working recovery, for those who have pain and are also an addict, etc.

-Clean or not?: This question gets asked a lot here and there is no right answer for it. Suboxone can greatly assist in working your recovery, making personal progress, rebuilding your life, getting off dope when nothing else seems to stop you, saving your life, and so on. To those that are in NA and/or are fully abstinent from all opiates and drugs, then no they wont consider you clean. But if you are clean from your opiate abuse, from full agonists, from your addiction, and are using it as intended then that can be considered clean too.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Feeling better on much lower dose?. I am running low on subutex and can’t make it to the doctor so I cut my dose from my standard 8 mg (down from a high of 16) to between 1-3 mg. I’ve done this several times over the years and each time I do this I notice I feel a hell of a lot better . Less brain fog, can wake up in the morning/ more energy and generally just not as drugged and lethargic feeling. Not so blah.
I’m wondering though, is it because I’ve cut my dose so low that I’m actually conversely now feeling an opiate effect that’s giving me a false sense of well being? 
Or does it just mean that my standard suboxone dose is too high and it’s making me feel crappy and I should just try to stay on a low dose at all times?
I always say I will but somehow when I have a full script I tend to go right back to starting point- even though it generally does nothing good for me.

Last month I asked for a dose reduction for some reason so asking for MORE would be backtracking. I use QuickMD, so different doctor every month usually.

"Recovery after Buprenorphine patches. Hello, I am a person with CRPS since 2017 so my palliative doctor prescribed buprenorphine patches for LIFE, starting at 5 micrograms, 9 months (non stop) ago but it's been hell, from lucid nightmares, parkinsonism, respiratory depression, anorexia, word confusion and speech problems .

"Puddle of sweat...?. F age 48. I've been on buprenorphine since March of this year (7 months) I'm a chronic pain patient that was previously on oxycodone. The buprenorphine has been working just fine for me, no relapses. At first I was prescribed Suboxone, but now I'm on Belbuca 480mg BID.

For the past few months I've been getting sweatier and sweatier - sweat just running down my back, under my breasts, at the crotch area, and my head, crook of arms/back of knees. I literally sweat through my clothing and need to change once or twice and use adult bath wipes for comfort. At first I thought it could be hot flashes? but I'm on the birth control pill and my Dr. said that cancels out the usual hormonal fluctuations, so she doesn't think that's my problem. 

Then I thought maybe it could be the buprenorphine? Is it possible that I would need a dose adjustment or this is just a normal side effect? I've been experiencing more pain than usual, but I've been taking additional gabapentin to deal with it (which I'm also prescribed) (Ideally I would prefer to not be on Belbuca or be on a lower dose but my pain is 10/10 horrible without it) I don't have any other of my typical telltale withdrawal symptoms such as yawning and tachycardia.

Well I was told to increase my klonipin and that didn't even work. So now I'm backing down off the klonipin after a week of 2-3mg from the episode that went on for about a week. 

I walked out of work and to a leave of absence due to it catching up to me and my boss not happy with me 3hrs sleep, a bit irritable from the klonipin as well. So I just left last Sunday morning and says I may need to take a leave. My doc gave me antidepressants and I tried for a few days. It made my symptoms worse and created more so I stoped. 

So im at a confusing crossroads. I don't feel I'm depressed. Yes I do have anxiety at times especially late at night but it was getting better and then suddenly got bad. I'm not sure if adding more meds is the answer and that it's possibly a PAWS related episode triggered possibly by job stress with unrealistic expectations at times, randomness and also finding a suboxone and almost relapsing shortly before all this took place. As you can see I'm fighting this hard to stay clean and in it for the long haul.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Experience with Zubsolv?. Soooooo, I just made a post about Suboxone about 2 hours ago. But what I don't see very often is the topic of Zubsolv. Have any of you ever been on it? My experience with it was that it was a little dangerous for me as an addict. Granted it's literally the same solution as Suboxone. My thing is, is that it still gave me a GREAT buzz. And that my friend, calls for some major self destruction. I found myself still in the same habits as I would be taking something off the street. Taking it in ways I shouldn't be, doing things I shouldn't be to obtain it. So, in MY experience, it was not helpful. It kept me away from other substances.. but I still acted like an addict.

"Kratom while on suboxone? Or suboxone and valerian root?. Hi, I am on 16mg suboxone, have been for 5 years now. I’ve tried SSRI meds before and they either gave me brain shivers or left me worse off than I was before so I never took them long. I would prefer to still feel like me… just 99% less tense and panicky. Just want to breathe..

I have never tried kratom or valerian root. But I am at a point where I would try just about anything (preferably nonaddictive) to get over the debilitating anxiety I have been experiencing lately. I did have a few Xanax for emergency use so I did take one yesterday and today, but I am not really trying to make it a habit.

I was researching a little bit about kratom and I always see people talking about it. Have never tried it myself. I can’t find any info on using it WHILE being on suboxone. Is this because of an interaction or because it’s dangerous or something? 

I was also reading about valerian root and wondering if anyones had any luck with either of these and any info you can give me would be super helpful. I did come across GABA as well but I have no idea about any of this stuff so hoping someone here might. Absolutely any input is greatly appreciated! 🌸",0,0,0,1,0,0
"Shout out to my CVS. I feel the need to share how awesome my local CVS was this week.  

Back story: I've been on suboxone since 2012 so I was on the name brand strips for many years and then switched to the Sandoz generic when insurance stopped covering the brand name. No issues at all with that, I could tell no difference, as the Sandoz generic is made by the brand name company. 

Years go by with me on Sandoz when suddenly earlier this year they filled my script with Alvogen. Now don't get me wrong, for those who are new to suboxone or don't have much prior experience with the brand name, Alvogen will probably work just fine, but for those of us old timers used to the higher quality, Alvogen is just not quite up to par. The packaging to the strip itself just feels ""cheap"" and ""nasty"" to me. Even so I still gave them a try and after about a week on them, I could tell this was not for me. 

When my next script was due to be filled I called CVS and requested they only fill my perscriptions with Sandoz; they had no issue with that as I'm a good customer and don't usually give them any shit. They marked my account as SANDOZ PREFERRED and all was well for months, till I got a new script this week. The pharmacist called saying they did not have enough Sandoz to fill my prescription so they gave me a partial fill of 3 days worth of Sandoz and ordered more Sandoz. I called to check the next day and they said the order came in but it was Alvogen, so they put in another order for Sandoz. Now I'm thinking oh shit, I'm going to be stuck with these awful yellow strips going forward like others I've read about online. Another day goes by and I call CVS back, yet again the Sandoz did not come in but they said it should be in tomorrow. At this point I think they're just stringing me along but no, the third day after the third attempt at ordering the Sandoz, it did come in and I got my full script with it. So here's a shout out to my local CVS - thank you for being persistent and standing up for your customers!!",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Update on my Taper. As of 1:50pm CST today I took my last 1mg dose and have jumped. Now, I have not discontinued my doctor's care nor am I out of medication. But, I put the remainder of my films and locked them in my little lockbox, gave them to my most trusted closest friend to store at his house to take any type of want and close proximity away. I have my next refill set for Friday August 13th, but have also taken off work for the next two weeks. Meaning that if this first attempt at jumping off lasts for those two weeks I'm certain I will not be putting that next order in. Not only that, but I'm banking on that the horror show that is the initial physical hell should have passed over in the next two weeks. In the grand scheme of it all my goal to be completely off has been Dec 31st of this year since I started the taper Jan 1st of this year. Lastly, if somehow jumping off early with this attempt sticks, why not enjoy accomplishing my end goal some months earlier. In recent years when jumping off at different amounts I usually do not feel any discomfort for a good few days, and of course no difference in feeling these past 12hrs. But, I know the worse is on deck and as always I will keep you all updated. Take it easy and have a good weekend guys.

Question about storing my suboxone while tapering.. So I'm doing a slow taper after being on subs for about 8 months. I was taking 2 8mg strips a day now I'm down to 1 8mg a day and am about to jump to 4mg a day. But my issue is I only have 8mg strips and don't have access to anymore unless I decide to do the web MD thing. So my question is once I start getting down to like 2 MG a day and lower how should I store what's left of my strip after I take my dose? Is it like dope where if you leave it out for a while it loses some of its potency or will it be fine sitting in the suboxone package inside a zip lock baggie? Thanks for reading.,0,0,0,0,1,0

I haven’t had this much fun in years. I danced today. I laughed. I actually felt “normal” I danced with my daughter in the kitchen for hours. My mind wasn’t wandering constantly about my next fix. I felt ok. I actually fucking felt OK. I fUCKING FEEL OK!!!!!! This is absolutely huge, I have been so depressed,
Down, and dying inside and didn’t even know what normal happiness felt like - and fucking here I am in the middle of detoxing still and I don’t feel the demon on my back. 
If you can get your hands on some mushrooms to boost your serotonin levels…….. for gods sake, do it. I feel like the constant bug in my ear telling me how fucked my life is really didn’t help me, that was gone today. 
Give it a try. 
That is all.

It was meh. At times, talking to people I haven’t seen in 7 years was horrific. I felt like a loser. Meeting new people was insane.

"I need the advice of the experts on this sub. I've been taking bupe for about 3 years now and have managed to wean down from 16mg to 2.5mg until about 8 days ago when i was gifted 900mg of oxy for free.

So i switched over to the oxy , about 100mg per day every a.m. at the same time i'd take my bupe usually.

My goal ultimately was to wean off suboxone slowly but i seem to struggle once i get down below 2.5mg or 2mg...like slight WD kicks in...

Today i switched back to bupe but i only did about 1mg an hour ago....

I guess my question is, should i just try to taper down to .125 by reducing my 1mg dose in half every few days or something or should i switch back to maybe a lower dose of oxy for a few days and then take maybe .5 mg of bupe when i switch back?

IDK i have tried what seems to be everything to wean off this crap.

Any suggestions , experiences or knowledgable advice would be much appreciated.

Got that all figured out and it was fine. 

Now, as for my question/concern.. my doctor gave me a heads up that he wasn’t sure if the Subs would be covered by the new insurance or not because “Insurance companies haven’t been approving Buprenorphine because they think people shouldn’t be on it.” I said, well shit.. so what are our options? I let him know it was approved last month, but his response was “to hope they cover it” .... is there some kind of new thing that prevents insurance companies from agreeing to cover Suboxone/generic Bupe?

"Suboxone dental issues. Hey suboxone sub,

I’ve recently found out that suboxone is linked to teeth damage. I knew that Methadone and suboxone “caused dental issues” and the link between poor dental hygiene and opioids.

I started suboxone nov2020.  I switched from Methadone to subs at 22mg (i believe). It was a bumpy week or so. In the ten years of Methadone i had my share of dental problems. Mostly because i neglected my teeth while active use. 

While on suboxone i have been incredibly meticulous about my dental hygiene. Since November 2020 i have had 4 extractions, one super complicated that required a bone graft in my sinus cavity because the infection spread so far. I have two more teeth that need root canals (possible extractions) one tooth literally cracked on a smarties candy, and a huge chunk came out. (I don’t eat candy since then so don’t judge me) and one other tooth that has some weird “dentin”  issue that the dentist can’t seem to understand.

I can’t afford the medical bills and the pain is insane. I started my taper last night from 8mg to 6mg.

Not knowing about the A1c results I decided to quit Suboxone and now my sugar reads 342.. feeling dizzy and have bloating and stomach pains.

"Buprenorphine Wafers? Purdue? WHAT?. While we already have multiple meds available for treatment there will soon be a new kind of ingestion method . Currently, we have dissolving films, tablets, injections and implants. So, how is the buprenorphine wafer different?

It’s all about speed.

Unfortunately, misuse of addiction treatment medications used in MAT is a problem. Therefore, drug makers are working hard to find new ways to stop this abuse of treatment meds. A new and novel approach is the fast dissolving buprenorphine wafer. Instead of taking minutes, this new med may dissolve in less than a minute. It is possible that it will melt away even faster, maybe even just seconds.

How does this help?

In many clinics, patients take their Suboxone or Subutex while being observed. They put the meds under their tongue and wait. Unfortunately, some patients sneak around like dinks and hide the tablets or taking films out of their mouth to misuse later. It is possible that an opioid addict could try to inject these tablets tho so there's that to be worried about . Because they were already in their mouth, this practice can lead to serious infections. One issue is that the patient has more opportunity to sneak the tablets out of their mouth when it takes longer for them to dissolve.

&#x200B;

The fast dissolving buprenorphine wafer.

If the wafer can dissolve in just a few seconds, there is far less opportunity for the patient to divert the meds out of their mouth. The wafer will quickly dissolve and the meds safely in the patient’s system. All this information i have summed together yet I have no flipping clue what mg they will be assigned to or if they are even going to continue this kind of research and or put into operation for patients.",0,1,0,0,0,0

"Running Out Early Question. Hi everyone, I have a question for the community and hope to find a good answer. 

I've been on suboxone (10mg total daily) for 6 months now without a hitch. It's helped me to stop using any illicit drugs completely and I haven't encountered any problems thus far. 

I was switched to 2-week prescriptions recently and this is where the problems started. I have Hep C, but have not had any treatment as my body has been fighting it off on its own. I am scheduled for another blood test soon to see where my levels are, but they've been so low that treatment is not recommended. 

The one symptom of Hep C that kills me is the joint aches. It feels like opioid withdrawal (restless legs/arms) and wakes me up in the middle of the night often. I can't stand it. This has led me to taking an extra strip (often cutting smaller pieces) from time to time to relieve the pain. I know, terrible choice. 

I'm now out of subs and have several days before my refill. I've been doing well and my doctor has been praising me, but now I am sick and feel like a failure/drug seeker. 

Should I call their office and be honest about my situation, or should I just try to hold out until the end of the week? Since this is my first problem, I think my doctor would be empathetic, but I'm pretty scared to come clean. 

I am going to ask to switch back to weekly appointments and ask my partner to hold onto my prescription but for the time being, what should I do? 

TIA

"Suboxone and bilateral anterior total hip replacement​. I have debated writing something here to get thoughts and advice for some time. I'm about 8 days out from having bilateral hip replacement surgery so I thought this was a good time.

I've been on subs for nearly 10 years. In that 10 years, I've had one other surgery where I took Subutex that I literally found, by some miracle, in my house about a week before the surgery.

This time though, that isn't going to happen.

I've spoken to the surgeon and my Suboxone doctor about this upcoming surgery and I've been told by my Suboxone doctor to stop taking subs 24 hours before surgery for the pain meds to work. I'm not sure I can do that first of all, but let's say I do, is that long enough for the pain meds to work from your experiences?

I've had the conversation about Subutex with the sub Dr several times. He is not willing to prescribe that or any other opiate ahead of time. I'm also not sure that the surgeon understands tolerance, though I don't get the feeling he's judging me for being a junky for nearly two decades, at least.

I also wondered if anyone had any experience similar to mine where they did not go back on Suboxone? If I had known 10 years ago what I know now about getting off this stuff, I never would have stayed on it like I have.

I did nearly 20 years of heroin addiction on and off so I wasn't a light user. I know my initial Suboxone Dr's point of view was that I would never get off of it because he felt it was too risky for me. At this point in my life, I don't feel that way. I'm fairly certain my head is in the best place it's ever been and relapse/using isn't ever even a fleeting thought any longer. I'm not stupid enough to think it can't come back though, especially when I have to do things like take pain pills to recover from a major surgery. I dunno. Thoughts and advice welcome.

"Day 1 @ 4mg x2. I posted the other day about wondering whether or not to start subs (again). I won’t go into my habit or why I chose it as the right option but here I am at day 1. I honestly thought 1mg would be enough, but here I am 4 hours after taking 1mg and I’ve taken 4mg total. 1mg then 2mg 2 hours later then 1mg an hour later. And I honestly don’t really feel anything except I’m not crawling out of my skin. I’m surprised as I remember subs being really powerful.

I hope it feels weak only cause it’s day 1 and that my second dose this afternoon (will start at 2mg) will have more of an effect to reduce my cravings. Right now I just feel like being/getting high. 

But I won’t. So for the first time in 6 years I’m going to go workout without being high. And I won’t have anything to reward myself with after. It’s so strange how strong the habit-part is, like my routine is now shattered and need be started anew and looking at the day ahead of me I just wonder what am I even going to do.

If how I feel now is how I will feel on subs everyday I may just wean very quickly and be done with it all. But I imagine they will feel stronger and I’ll need less over the coming days. Wish me luck. This is a huge commitment for me and a life changing decision. I hope my cravings are reduced and I can get to a once a day optimal dose and get my life back together.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Down from 8mg to 0.8mg - depression and anxiety kicking in. I feel great to have reduced (for 3rd time now!) to 0.8mg. The first time was forced on me, 2nd for a woman who is now my wife but stupidly thought I could 'occasionally' use which resulted in daily use and now 3rd time lucky I guess. I need to get off. My sex drive is nothing, with a beautiful wife and I either have no drive or cannot perform. I dropped to 0.8mg today and I feel terrible. Anxiety, RLS etc etc. Trouble is she does not know and Insomnia is on its way. I am trying so hard to keep dropping but man it is so hard. To the point now where I am in WD constantly, maybe I should just jump but I can already tell motivation for both work and home is suffering. I also have the added 'bonus' of having straight bupe, I also know I can insufficate and have been snorting lines. This definitely increases its effectiveness but also puts me back. My last jump I used to do small lines just enough to hold me but I want to be strict with myself and only use sublingual. But when I know a small line will sort me out to be functional it is hard to say no. Especially when it is only me and my prescriber that is aware.

"10 yr subutex addiction, using methadone to detox.. Im a 12 year heroin addict and for 10 years I've been on and off subs.. the last 2 years I've yet to relapse and feel like in in a bad spot with my subutex, let me explain.. personally I'd rather star6 using again and just kick dope because kicking subs I've only been able to do cold turkey one time in 10 years.. these last 2 years I've been pe4scribed 32mg of subutex a day(120x a month) and I've been Iving 24 mgs of that a day.. My body has takin a major toll doing this... I've done a 14 day methadone detox years ago to get off heroin and im so desperate to get off subs for good that im considering trying the 14 day methadone detox to get off subs.. or at least get through the worst of it... I have legit kratom (not the smoke shop shit) that I got years ago and will use that after the methadone detox for maybe 7 days and than just deal with the remain8ng withdrawal.. also just fyi, I am dealing with a 2nd dui that was drug related (cops found my needles with my subs , bars, and addys) so I am on home confinement with a scram sweat patch on my arm for the next 6 m9nths.. it only t3sts for: thc, amp, mAMP, coke, opiates, and pcp.

Has anyone got experience with this or maybe know someone who does...

Any helpful feedback will be appricieted. 

I know the dangers of methadone and am at the point in willing to deal with it.. (considering it will only be 14 days) 

Pushing this Orange sub mud into my veins multiple times a day is killing me on the inside..

"Gabapentin- Not so easy to aquire anymore ?. This was a topic,,, rather a prediction,,, many months ago. Its interesting to hear how those who profit view the drugs that actually work vs those that do not. Doctors have always made it difficult to acquire drugs that patients want unless they get to prescribe them. I remember reading an article on how doctors once wanted to make ibuprofen and acetaminophen Scheduled drugs- which only a doctor can prescribe. And not just any doctor, most say they cannot prescribe certain scheduled drugs like opiods- only pain management doctors may prescribe them, anything more than 3 days anyways. 

Now the medical community wants to place gabapentin as a Scheduled drug, making it harder to aquire. My old primary care provider could Not prescribe scheduled drugs as he said he refuses to ""pay the $6,000 for the software and thousands per month to use it- which is required to monitor scheduled drugs"".  At first glance it may appear about control and safety- but its just about the money imo. 

Making gabapentin a scheduled drug means the software/hardware is needed to verify prior/current prescription history, its makers get a cut $. The (PDMP) Prescription Drug Monitoring Program itself must be manned, they get a cut $. Then there is the pharmacy who Also needs the same hardware/software,, and provide labor needed for this extra verification step- more costs to pass on to patient$. Dont forget the lobbyists who are in the game by pushing such policies- they get a cut too $$$. Then there's the politicians who move to back the requests by lobbyists- there nasty little paws are grabbing for their cut also $$$$. Making it more difficult might seem to be a move for safety reasons,  Or is it ?

"Suboxone detox please help. I’m reaching out hoping someone with experience will see this. When I got out of inpatient treatment last year I decided to go on MAT and stay on. I regret it. I came out on 16mg a day, then went down to 12mg, and now I’m at 8mg a day sometimes 10mg depending on the day (films not pills). Suboxone is a great drug for certain people but the effects it’s having on me isn’t too great. The last few months I’ve been experience side effects like increase in depression. Like most people, when I take my dose (4mg in the morning, 4mg in the evening, and some days 2mg in the middle of the day), I get a boost in energy and ready for whatever. However as the months have went on I’m constantly clock watching and planning my daily tasks on when I take my next dose so I have the energy to accomplish them. When I was on 16mg a day, I never ran into this issue because I would just take 4mg constantly throughout the day and be ready for whatever. I also have some issues with my thyroid so I know at least part of my issues are because of that but I just feel like the Suboxone is also a issue. I never had a big problem until I dropped to 8mg a day and that was about 5 months ago now. I’ve been on Suboxone total for just over a year. 

So that brings me to my question just wanted to give a little background first. I thankfully am lucky enough have the option to go into a detox center next month. However the doctor told me it would just be a 6-10 day detox depending on how I’m doing. That doesn’t make sense to me. I’ve read that even though your brain might think different, Buprenorphine will last up to 72 hours after last dose. I’ve also read that withdrawal/detox  from Buprenorphine is worse than withdrawal/detox from regular opiates like oxy and heroin. And I’ve heard not only is it worse but takes longer as well to detox. So if I take my normal dose the day prior to going into detox, and the effects can last 72 hours, how the hell am I going to be okay with just 7 days at max left in detox? This will be my fourth treatment center in my life so I get it…I know it’s not supposed to be comfortable or easy, but if these withdrawals are worse than opiates and last longer, I have no idea how 7 days will help me at all. Does anyone have experience, advice, or been through anything like this? If so I would greatly appreciate it. 

Side note - I do not do well with withdrawal at all. I’m not mentally tough at all when dealing with that. Way worse than most people in my opinion.",0,0,1,0,0,0

So now I hafta find another pharmacy and I remember when I first started going how horrible it was, either everyone isn’t taking new clients, you hafta live a certain distance, or they’d judge you harshly, at least in PA they do.

"Fast Taper After Prolonged Use. Interested in taper support, I’ve been sucked into the world of daily suboxone after an inconsistent oxycodone habit that was originally upwards of 150mg/day; for over 2 years, aside from a few months I tried to stop, I’ve been temporarily stopping my suboxone use to go on 200-240mg/day oxycodone binges before transitioning back on to suboxone, settling somewhere in the 2-3mg mark before the next binge came around. I finally got the guts to stop and after my last week-long full agonist binge, having been off of suboxone for about 7 days and purely on oxycodone, I transitioned into a quick taper as below:

Day 1: 11mg suboxone, 14mg loperamide, 0.3mg clonidine, 2mg clonazepam nightcap (very anxious, symptomatic day)

Day 2: 6mg suboxone split into 3 2mg doses, 8mg loperamide, 0.2mg clonidine, 2mg clonazepam nightcap

Day 4: 3mg suboxone split into 2 1.5mg doses, 0.2mg clonidine, 2mg clonazepam nightcap 

Day 5: 2.6mg suboxone split into 2 1.3mg doses, 0.2mg clonidine, 2mg clonazepam nightcap

Day 6: 1.75 mg suboxone split into a 1mg am and 0.75mg PM dose, 0.2mg clonidine, 2mg clonazepam nightcap 

Day 7: 1.3mg suboxone single AM dose, 0.1mg clonidine, 2mg clonazepam nightcap

After a month withdrawal and being completely debilitated I was still sick and nowhere near ready to return to work or resume my daily family/ parental responsibilities. I found myself at a crossroads and made the decision to start taking Buprenorphine daily. 
I have not relapsed over the last 17 years and never have cravings. That’s the good part. 
I feel very vulnerable being on a medication that if for any reason I am unable to access, within a day I will be very sick and unable to function. 
Finding the best dose has been challenging.  I receive my medication from a compound pharmacist who is able to make small adjustments allowing me to easily titrate higher or lower. I have been hovering around 5 mg a day for the last several years.  
There are a lot of days I don’t feel that great and wonder to what degree the  buprenorphine is playing a role. I have read in posts from other long-term patients that the medication leaves people feeling draggy or foggy after a while. Has that been your experience? I would welcome hearing from others who have been taking the medication for years.",0,1,0,0,0,0

"Day 14 after quitting suboxone. Day 14- Just as a recap, I did a 5 day TCI med detox from a massive 72-84 mg per day biologically hacked sub habit (felt like a strong opiate) and had naltrexone pellet put in day 5. Helper meds during the detox. Drug profile by sub dr last week said no bup (or anything else). 

Most days feel like a very minor cold, including today. Kind of like quitting a smallish kratom habit. Some minor back aches from old injury, but manageable. No rls and no pain or restlessness. Had about 2 days this last week where I pretty much did not sleep (thurs, Fri). Insomnia left me and last night I got 7 hours of sleep. 

Generally positive and motivate daily. Today was one of those days. Energy is returning. Feel about 80% normal. I ran a sprint segment 10 k yesterday. I am planning to return to the crossfit, cycle and personal training this week.

"“Pay the piper” and other common phrases with addiction. Recently, I have seen a few posts using the phrase that someone “has to pay the piper” at some point, whether it is going through withdrawal from the person’s opiate drug of choice or eventually tapering off of sub and going through sub withdrawal. I have never thought much about the phrase until another poster pointed out that the phrase gives the false implication that everyone deserves to pay via the pain of withdrawal because of our struggles, choices, and likely shitty behavior at times. After I read this, I agree with this point of view. I don’t think the disease model of addiction is correct (it is too simplistic and inconsistent), but, I think a medical analogy is appropriate. I mean we (society) never tell cancer patients they have to “pay the piper” when they get really sick during chemo treatments etc. So why do opiate addictions deserve pain? Thoughts?

I know there are a lot of other sayings and phrases associated with sub and addiction that I think are harmful. Another one the really bugs me is “people are in denial or just aren’t ready for help” these are false because people deal with fear, anxiety, barriers, etc. but the phrases are just more “victim blaming” which is bullshit. Then with sub specifically there are things like sub docs are government sanctioned drug dealers or sub is the governments generic heroin etc. I think all these catchphrases just had to shame and stigma (external and internal). Thoughts?

"Made it to day 30 without suboxone.. It feels like yesterday when I finally made the jump. 

Here’s the backstory. I’ll try not to drag it out too much.

I started with pills on and off in ‘07. I was really hooked on opiates by 2010. My cousin handed me a sub and I immediately felt like I never took anything ever. The WD feeling went away. After that, I bought subs off of the street until 2011. My plug stopped having them so I CT’d off of 6-8 mgs. It was hell on earth. I had no idea what subs were and how powerful they were. I just knew they took all my cravings away. However, after 2-3 days of WDs, I found out how powerfully they were.

I remember looking up the World Record for days without sleep. I was on day 7 without any sleep. I just stared at my ceiling, tossing and turning...praying to get some sleep. It never happened. I didn’t know about comfort meds, so I just took NyQuil hoping that would help. It made it worse.

I finally went to the doc and he prescribe Klonopin. That finally helped me sleep after day 8.

Anyway, I made it three months without any subs or opiates. I only took a klonopin before bed. In those three months, I always felt terrible. I never really got over it. So...I relapsed. I relapsed in the worst way. 

I ended up spending like $200/day on pills. I’d buy adderall and whatever opiate pill I could find. I had dealers ripping me off. I’d go to some of the nastiest houses and hang out with some bad people just to get my fix. I kept doing this for six years. Six years of wasting all that time and money. 

The reason I never went back to subs is because the WDs terrified me. But I ran out of money. I dipped into my retirement, I maxed out credit cards. Finally, I went to a sub doc in May 2017.

The addiction specialist said I should start with 16mg; I started with 6mg. I decided I wanted to go as low as I could. I was fine on 6mg. I felt like that was a good starting point. 

Eventually, all the side effects kicked in. I was tired all the time, I had brain fog, depression, teeth issues, anxiety, irritability, weight gain, and I isolated myself from the outside world. I’d work, then come home and watch TV. I stopped answering text messages and phone calls. A lot of my friends stopped bothering to contact me.

So...I decided it was time to get off. I started working out every morning before work and I slowly tapered down. The taper was fairly painless until I got to 1mg. Once I hit 1mg, I never stabilized. I was on 1mg for three months and it felt like I was constantly in mild WD. I don’t know why it felt like that. I think it could’ve been because I was breaking the 2mg pill and I would lose some or because I was working out 5-6 days a week. I thought the sub might be metabolizing to fast. I don’t know.

Because I felt like I was in constant WD, I figured, fuck it. Why am I dragging this out? I talked to my AS and he said since I was in such a low dose, it shouldn’t be bad (he actually thought I was on 2mg). The doc gave me a two week supply of lucemyra and said good luck. I took the next week off of work and was ready...really ready to break free from subs and pills. 

Well, as crazy as this sounds, I really didn’t have any bad WDs. When I would have some RLS, I’d take a lucemyra. I took two during the day and two at night. I would get 6-7 hours of sleep. It was hard to get out of bed and my brain was foggy, but not so bad. After two weeks, I stopped taking lucemyra. I remember how great it felt to finally have a day without any sort of pill whatsoever.

Now, here I am on day 30. Each day I take a daily vitamin, cod liver oil, and vitamin B complex. I also work out every morning and drink tons of water. I’m still a bit hazy and lethargic, but it’s nothing I can’t handle. 

I think what really helped me this time was my mindset. When I originally WD from subs, I kept waiting to wake up hoping I’d feel 100 percent. It would drive me insane that after two then three months, I was still feeling so terrible. I thought I was broken. I just wanted it to stop. 

This time, I have the mindset that I’m not going to feel 100 percent and that’s OK. I learned to adjust through my taper; therefore, I can adjust without any subs. Eventually, I’ll be back to 100 percent (I feel close), but for now, I know I need to give a little more effort to get out of bed, to make it to the gym, to be productive at work, to maintain relationships. It’s something I’ve accepted and soon enough, I’ll be back to 100 percent. It may not be tomorrow or even next month, but I’ll get there. In the meantime, I’ll have to maintain at 80 percent. No big deal.

I’m happy that I went back to subs. They helped me get my life back. I’m still working on paying off my debts, but I’ve made a ton of progress. I understand that a lot of people will need to stay on subs forever, and that’s fine. I think they’re much better than the alternative. However, the side effects for me were too much. They were taking my soul away. I never really laughed on them. My feelings were almost nonexistent. I didn’t want to continue through life as a zombie (again, that’s just the way I felt on them). For me, I knew I had to get off.

Thanks for all the support on r/suboxone. I know I couldn’t get through it without following this subreddit. It really is a huge help. I know I still have a long way to go, but I’m actually looking forward to the journey. 

Damn...looks like I dragged it out after all.",0,0,1,1,1,0
"Actavis orange vs hikma pharm white subutex?.

I have had a battle with heroin, fentanyl, and the m30s. Mainly shooting, snorting and smoking. Doing all routes routinely. But I’m sober since January 30th. So that would give me about 5 months sober. This has been my second attempt in my life to get sober the first time I got sober I was able to do about 9 months and on suboxone

Dosage second time coming around due to some anxiety meds I got prescribed (kpin) I got dropped to 16 mg sub a day

Freaking out - Pharmacy Screwed Up. I guess this is just me venting but please feel free to offer any advice. I’ve been having issues getting my prescriptions filled the past few months because my prescribing PA doesn’t have a supervising physician. My doctors office swears they don’t need it but our states licensing board and all the pharmacies disagree. They had me switched my pharmacy (again) to try and get it filled. But now the pharmacy they withdrew the prescription from (CVS) is saying I picked up my medication and that I won’t be able to fill it until February. I haven’t even stepped foot in CVS today and they told me themselves they couldn’t fill it. The new pharmacy received the prescription but said they won’t know until Monday if the February pick up is reflecting on their end. My pick up date should be Monday but I think CVS messed up when withdrawing my prescription. If you have any recommendations for a good Telehealth clinic please let me know. I work throughout the day so anything that requires me to do video calls or meetings during business hours won’t work. I can’t keep doing this every month and I’m fed up with my doctors office at this point,1,0,0,0,0,0

I dont have the suboxone yet but im going to a clinic first thing in the morning to go get it prescribed.

From what ive gathered from this subreddit is that the bernese method would be a good option in not experiencing too bad of withdrawals. I found the dosages for each day from this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trKRk-WS228](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trKRk-WS228)

and know to essentially microdose the subs for a couple days and use fent as needed (to stop wd's) before completely stopping the fent once the subs have taken over the receptors and then taking a full dose of the subs around day 7 of the method.

How long since last smoking fent do i need to wait before beginning microdosing?

How do i figure out the dosages of the suboxone strip though?

my plan is to cut the 8mg strip into 8 pieces and then cutting one of those pieces into 4 and then one of those 4 would be .25mg

So my story is essentially I’m looking for a way to get away from kratom with the help of a doctor so I am no longer self medicating. I am looking for similar benefits to what kratom provided me with. Motivation, general sense of well-being, and inner peace. Normally I would be way more pro kratom then suboxone, but I happened to have a weird reaction the last time I took kratom and I ended up having a seizure that almost ended my life. For that reason alone I will never touch that plant again, I had no idea that could happen from taking kratom. 

When I’ve tried suboxone in the past with no / low opioid tolerance it was exactly like I expected. A low euphoria less recreational opiod feeling that was very long lasting and effective but not something you could abuse without having nasty side effects. 

Unfortunately I just got my first prescription for suboxone the other day and so far I have not been able to get the desired benifts from it I’m looking for. I started with 2 mg and it was absolutely nothing (still in pain level of nothing) so I took 3 then 2 hours later another mg for a total of 4 mg assuming that that would be more than enough, but still seems very weak, not getting those benefits I did the first time I tried suboxone. So today I started with 4 then took another 2mg and still wasn’t even close to what I was expecting/ looking for :(

I’m worried I’m going to go back to craving kratom if this is the extent of my suboxone experience. I’m not sure how I don’t notice anything from 6 mg when I was just using kratom and had been tapering off for multiple days before I started the subs. 

What dose do you think I should try? I’m probably gonna start with 7 or 8 tomorrow even tho I never thought I’d need to go that high. Do you think I should take 2mg for a couple of days then go back to 4-6 and see if it’s more effective?",0,1,1,1,0,0
"I know this isn’t the right way to do things... But has anyone figured out how to change the chemical structure of these bad boys in you body and get high off of them? Something like grapefruit juice? I’m itching for a way to get high off my subs.

"I have a question for my fellow gamers.. I know it sounds weird reading that title but let me explain. I’ve been on Suboxone for like 6 months now and I’m on 12mg/day. (1 12mg strip)

I play a lot of first person shooter games and lately I’ve been noticing when i take my meds around noon my aim goes down the drain. Like there’s a fog between my brain and hands that doesn’t allow me to be as accurate. it sometimes is so bad it feels foreign and I play all the time.

just curious, because i’ve been cutting like 1/5th of it off and am starting to feel a little less foggy, thinking about just cutting it in half next time and hoping for the best.

side effects include loss of concentration and coordination so hoping i can just lower my dose until it’s not an overwhelming sensation….

I feel GREAT! I’ve been getting so much done. I didn’t realize how taking that much was really dragging me down. Before, if I tried to take less, I would feel like I was in withdrawal so I don’t know what’s different but I won’t be going back to 2 a day. Hopefully even less from here!",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Stressed out don’t know what do to. So I have been going to through this place for Suboxone for about 9 months, Been clean the same amount of time about. End of February I was in a car wreck where I broke my neck and back. I was in the hospital for a week then went to a physical rehab for 8 days, so I was out of work. I had not been at the job long enough to collect any disability so I fell behind with lots of bills including with my Suboxone provider.

No place that prescribers Suboxone around here takes my insurance, so I found the one with cheapest monthly payment which is 200$. After being in a neck brace for 2 1/2 months and going back to work after 3 months. Which was honestly too early considering the injuries but I had to, I needed money. Right now I have very little money until next Friday. I just paid rent, water and electricity. 

   My Suboxone provider will not help me out anymore I already owe them a couple months worth. Even if he did my script is 80$ because with goodrx cause my damn insurance dont cover suboxone either.

So I am completely stressed out. Thinking about having to go cold turkey. When going thru heroin withdrawal I could not go to work.How will I go to work withdrawing off subs. This is just going to be all bad. I have literally 2mg of suboxone left and havent taken none in about 36 hours.
The little money I got I could afford a little bit of dope but still wont get me to next Friday.

Going back to subs after using fent for 3 days. I know the usual rule is wait 24 hours and I’ve done that before when I needed Norco and morphine for pain and had no issues. But since fent is stronger I’m wondering if I need to wait longer. It’s officially been 24 hours now and about 4 hours ago I took Klonopin for some cold sweats I believe I was starting to get. Btw it was dirty 30s that I took and I only used 3 of them over the three days. So I’m wondering how soon I can take the subs again. For now the plan is to use the klonopin to ward off the worst of it. I may wait until tonight and try taking a small piece of a sub.,0,1,1,1,0,0
Subs vs methadone. So I’ve been on subs for quite a few months now. I’m on 12 mg. My biggest struggle since taking subs has been with cocaine. I seem to always have it in my system even if I only use once a week. Because of this my doctor is talking about putting me on methadone. If I fail another test I won’t have an option. I will go daily instead of weekly. I do not want this but may not have a option if I can’t stay clean. What are your thoughts/opinions on this?  Has anyone dealt with this?,0,1,0,1,0,0
"My taper method.. Ok so what if you woke up and skipped your dose.  Waited however many hours for the first symptoms of w.d. presented themselves?  Be they mental or physical, you know your body.  Once symptoms are present then administer the lowest dose you possibly can, like .5.  Wait the proper absorption time and then repeat this until you feel better.  

Be honest with yourself.  I know I always want to take more.  But stop it at the lowest dose you can where symptoms subside. Repeat this process for a week.  Or two weeks.  Whatever you feel comfortable with.  When you're ready for stage 2 do this same process but only every 2 days.  And then every 3 days.  And then jump.  

To me it seems like easing withdrawal pain, and tapering is just about taking that hardcore withdrawal you would have after jumping off an 8mg dose, and spreading it out over a period of time.  Taking a little pain here and there instead of all at once.",0,1,0,0,1,0

"Tapering from Different Opioid Instead. Ignoring the addiction side of things for one second, does anybody have any first hand knowledge or data regarding whether or not switching from Suboxone to Oxycodone (or similar) is easier than tapering from Suboxone itself?

From my experience, the most difficult thing about Suboxone withdrawal is the length of time it takes to feel better. And while Oxycodone was more acute (barely), it was over in a week. 

I feel like being able to know where to finish line is would make an oxy taper easier. So, if you made the switch and then started tapering, and assuming you got low enough, would it be easier do you think?

I am aware that someone will want to say “if you could taper off oxy, you would have done that”, but that isn’t true in my case. 

The problem is, other than not knowing if it WOULD be easier, is equivalency. If I taper Suboxone down to 2mg and switch over, how much am I switching over to without going into withdrawal? And how long to wait?

I know this isn’t the best way. I am considering Sublocade, but for some reason I’m afraid. Or can’t make myself believe all the success stories. 

Anyway - any insight (other than “dumb idea”) would be appreciated.",0,0,1,1,1,0

"subs for kratom. hi, lurker here. I have used kratom 5x a day for almost 3 years. never missed a beat. I wake up to withdrawal every morning and I was sick and tired of being dependent on something I must take multiple times a day. my Dr suggested subs. I am currently on day 7 of subs, aside from occasional cravings for something (can't put my finger on it) I am kratom free. I have been trying to kick the k for 6 months by tapering and I always give in.. I would take an upwards of 15-20 gs of kratom a day. On a light (good) day, I'd take 10.

Am I making a mistake switching to subs for a k addiction?

I am taking 1 mg a day of the subs and it seems to do the trick.

"Need a little advice. About a month ago, I made a decision to drop my daily dose from 24 mg/day to 8 mg /day. I was taking 24 mg/day for about 2 continuous years. Just decided I was ready to get off subs and was just going to try dropping to 8 mg. I didn’t go through any acutes after dropping. Life went on. 

For the last month, I would take my 8 mg when I awoke early along with gabapentin and coffee. Subs kicked in about 20 min. Felt normal. Just normal. 

In last few days, I feel like 8 mg subs is wearing off in evening. I am getting the unease feeling again. Craving I guess? It’s not severe, but it feels like I need something to feel normal. Feels like a mild case of anxiety and low mood. 

I guess my body is getting good at metabolizing 8 mg subs faster during the day. Don’t know. I tried added in 4 mg after dinner and that unease or need for something feeling goes away.

Questions:

1. Should I keep taking 4 mg in afternoon or evening? I want to be dropping my dose and not increasing it. I’m afraid if I take 12 mg daily for too many days, my body will adjust to it. 

2. Should I just wait/tough it out? Maybe it will get better in a few days or maybe in a week. I really want to drop to 4 mg soon without the unease feeling I describe.

"First time user. Hello, I’ve recently started suboxone about 2 weeks ago, I’m on 8 mg daily. I usually dose at around 4:00 am and have been feeling normal up until around 3:00 p.m yesterday. I started getting extremely tired, high levels of anxiety and lethargic. I thought I was catching some sort of cold and brushed it off, well it happened again today around the same time and I came to realize I might be withdrawing from the subs so I went ahead and took another 4 mg an hour ago and feel completely fine. 

           Is there a reason I’m starting to withdrawal off my dose so early in the day? I have read it has an extremely long half life and I shouldn’t feel any withdrawal symptoms for Atleast 48 hours. Also, will I get into trouble for finishing my script early? I’m new to suboxone clinics and have no idea how strict they are with these type of situations.",0,1,1,0,0,0
"2mg suboxone for 5 years. Started 6 years ago at 12 mg and quickly lowered my dose. Even within the first year I was skipping doses, wish I would’ve just quit then. Now I’ve been trying to get off my dose for at least 2 years and now any time I try I can barely make it a day without withdrawals. I think a lot of it is in my head as someone with severe anxiety. 

The clinic I go to obviously does not want me off it anytime I’ve tried talking to them about it they tell me I can just live my whole life on it and discourage it.  But I just would like to live my life without it, see who I am without it, not depend on the pharmacy to control whether I get to be sick or not depending off if they have it in stock, and most importantly me and my long term partner want to have a baby but until I can get off of it it’s not in the cards. I’ve changed my life around 100% since I got clean and those days are way past me and I feel like this is last piece to that puzzle. 

Anyway- any tips tricks or whatever that can help me finally kick this would be much appreciated.

"Getting off subs in july!. Hey all,
I just made a plan with my doctor today about jumping off the subs in July! By then it will be 23 months on the Suboxone. I give a lot of credit to this med because it really helped me get my life back on track. I am honestly just getting fed up with the side effects. I hate being zombified, depressed, having low libido, having no energy, having amped up anxiety, etc. I know a ton of people get side effects and i know some people don’t. Sadly for me I feel like I deal with all the worst side effects. 

i weened down from 16mg a day to about .5 every day and next month i’ll be skipping days. I never had a problem weening and I did it really slowly. I never felt sick or felt any bad withdrawal as i was going down and that’s probably because most of the time i was weening very slowly. The thing i wanted to ask is for positive feedback on getting off the subs and to see if people feel better once they’re off? Will my libido come back? Will i have more energy? Will i feel normal again? I’m aware some of this may take some time to come back. Im 22 years old and i feel like an old man. I just can’t wait to start my real sobriety and to be off of all the meds i’m on. I was always really healthy before the drugs and i hope my life will go back to that. I appreciate all of the advice you guys give me. I am fully aware the withdrawal will suck, I have quit Xanax cold turkey after years of abusing it. I am just so motivated to get off the subs that I am willing to feel like shit for a little while. My job is supportive of me to take time off work and I am just so thankful that I have a full life ahead of me.

"UM. I can feel Opioid despite Suboxone?. Ok. Someone is gonna need to give me some education.

I’m on 6mg of Suboxone, divided into 3 x 2mg doses daily for 5 years.

I have a dental infection against a branch of my temporal nerve that hasn’t responded to antibiotics. As such, they haven’t been able to freeze the tooth for extraction and have referred me to an oral surgeon.

So I have QUESTIONS:

First, out of pure desperation, when Torodol and Tylenol, I thought I would see what if anything would happen if I took 5mg of oxycodone - expecting nothing, but willing to try anything.

Now, it’s not as strong as it might have otherwise been, and I would say the biggest difference is that it isn’t really “euphoric”, but I’ve caught one heck of a buzz. Maybe more than a buzz. Like, that “haze” feeling opioids give? Got that. Big time relaxation. Pain relief. And, my respiratory rate is a little different. Nothing too serious. I hope. It’s been about an hour since I took it. 

But, HOW?! It’s 5mg for god’s sake. This makes ZERO sense based on EVERYTHING I’ve read. Tell me how this is happening. I wouldn’t call it a “pleasant” high, but it’s at least having some of the desired effect, but it’s pretty WEIRD.

Second question - the dentist suggested Lyrica but then did an interaction check and said that it was a major interaction with Suboxone. He said I could double check with my pharmacist (which I intend to do), but wondered if anyone else takes Lyrica/PREGABELIN, not for withdrawal but while on a full dose of Suboxone? Ideally for pain. It would only be 25mg. Any issues? Does it work for pain for you? Any advice/insight?

"Really Struggling - How long does it take you to ""stabilize"" after a dose cut?. I started at 2mg twice a day.  Made it down to 1.75mg twice a day without too much trouble (3.5mg per day).  I mean, it sucked, I could definitely feel it, but nothing I couldn't handle.  The next dose cut was 1.65mg twice a day, obviously that's a pretty small reduction.  But it was extremely hard.  It's like I hit that threshold where it suddenly feels impossible.  For a couple hours after each dose I'd be ok, but then long before my next dose I'd be going into pretty bad withdrawal feelings.  Anxiety was through the roof, losing a ton of sleep, chills and burning skin, that sick feeling I know everyone here knows.  

I thought ""ok, this is rough but I just need to push through and I'll even out soon,"" so I stuck it out.  For over a month.  A month and a week actually.  I *never stabilized.*  After a month I still felt just as bad as I did during the first week after the drop.  The thought of cutting even more was just too much.  Everyone here (mostly anyway) say to wait and stabilize at a dose before making a cut again.  But what if you never stabilize??  I finally gave up and went back up to 1.75mg twice per day.  

It's pretty demoralizing.  And even frightening to think of what's in store further along, assuming I'm ever able to continue.  It's commonly said around here how it starts getting hard once you're below 2mg/day, but I can't even drop below *3.5mg* per day.

"Should I volumetric dose?. I've read alot of positive feedback concerning suboxone tapering,  and some bs. I have been on suboxone for 6mos. Was overprescribed 20mg per day and then cut off at the 5th month of treatment,  insurance company crap. No relapses,  no oxycodone  cravings.  I'm using  4mg strips and am cutting them up in .5 and .25 mg pieces.  I've never felt good on suboxone and want to eliminate withdrawal.  I tried a 7day inpatient subutex detox and failed,  too fast. So here I sit at 1.75mg per day,  been here a week but still feel  pretty bad. My intention was to level out and then drop 
 a total of  .25mg, and allow a week or so in between  drops.

I've read that the strips ARE NOT EVENLY COVERED WITH THE BUPRENORPHINE.  If this is correct,  it would explain (maybe) why I sometimes feel rough and sometimes feel real rough.  Would volumetric dosing be the best approach? I've read about using a oral dosing  syringe,  (and yes I'm good at math) for all dosing below 2mg.

Also, I dose twice per day. Should I work at removing one of those doses to a one per day dosing schedule?

"IV question. hey everybody! hope you all are having as good of a night as you possibly can in each of your respectful situations! I made a throwaway for this cause its kinda embarrassing. This is a question I've had for a couple weeks now and only have one person to talk to about it, and they are kinda slow. ok so I've been addicted to subs on and off for probably 5 years or so. id say about 80 percent of the time I've ever been on subs its been IV. i know its bad. i dont even have a wheel filter. always got off the streets. up until recently finally got a doc for them. so now i get 60 5.7 mg zubsolve pills a month. they say that the 5.7 equals out to being the same as an 8mg sub strip, due to better absorption.

Heres the question:

"9 weeks after quitting subs cold turkey.. Was taking 1mg to 6mg a day (avg. 4mg) for 2 and a half years. I was taking subs to help my treatment resistant depression and I was not prescribed them. 

I quit them 9 weeks ago cold turkey and my life has been a living hell ever since. 

Some symptoms have improved, but over all I'm going through about what I did after week 1. At times I feel somewhat normal, but these periods end and I end up right back where I started. People here on this sub have described these episodes as the ""ups and downs of withdrawal"".

The thing I'm most concerned about is my extremely high blood pressure. I'm a very healthy young male, 25 and athletic. I eat well, hydrate well, sleep well. But still ever since I quit subs my blood pressure is almost always at or above 135 / 90. 

I also seem to lose feeling to my limbs very easily now. I get dizzy if I stretch even just a little and have to stand up so slowly that I feel like an elderly man. 

I have tried working out and exercising my way through a lot of this, but it just doesn't do anything. My motivation is shot either way. I can barely do anything basically.

"QuickMD. QuickMD doesn’t understand that some people use kratom to abate opioid withdrawals. My recommended doctor, chose not to allow me into the program because I was taking kratom and had use a low dose of benzodiazepines to abate my withdrawal symptoms from opioids. Instead of being understanding, I was chastised. I don’t trust their understanding. The “Doctor” was late, berated me and then told me I wasn’t right for the program because I said “kratom has opioid like effects”. She said it wasn’t FDA approved, like we all don’t know that already. She wanted a dumbed down patient who didn’t understand how opioids work and that’s not what she got and she was furious about it. She was unprofessional; he dogs interrupted the call the whole time. I’m upset at the lack of understanding this doctor had simply because she didn’t understand how kratom worked.

"Suboxone making me sick? What to do next?. I have been taking Suboxone for almost three weeks. Started at 4-8mg a day and recently increased to 12mg to see if it helps with anxiety and it didn’t. I feel horrible now. Back down to 4-8mg per day for three days, but I think the anxiety is way worse now since I now have anxiety about the possibility of suboxone making me sick. 

I often have negative side effects from any medication. At first, I noticed a little bit of nausea and headaches, but now I consistently feel nauseous, anxious, and just overall sick. It doesn’t help that I also came down with the flu or a bad cold (negative covid). At first, I thought it was all just from the flu, but now am convinced it is also the suboxone. Also now have problems at work, and at home, and most are my own doing/my own thinking. Really think it is all related to the suboxone. I don’t seem to do well with it. I still kind of feel like crap from the flu, but didn’t take my suboxone dose, waited, and then took a little bit of oxy (snorted like \~4mg) and I felt better almost immediately. More like myself again. 

Now super high anxiety because I don’t know what to do next. Do I try and taper the suboxone? Do I take enough oxy for a week to get past the suboxone wd’s and then taper the oxy? What about methadone? I didn’t want to be chained to a clinic, but is it less likely to have all these side-effects from methadone? If so, maybe it is a better option for me.

Yes, I am that person. I had never been physically dependent on opiates even though I have had several stints of abusing heroin heavily. Just never for more than X amount of days without X amount of days off and so on. I have taken Suboxone and Subutex in the past. For recreation.

Low dose suboxone. So I’m looking to taper down my suboxone from 16 mg to about 2 mg a day. I’ve heard I can drop to a lower dose pretty much immediately so what should I drop to initially?

"Low testosterone/sex drive. Hi all, hopefully this is an appropriate place for this, not really sure where else to ask. 

My boyfriend has been on subs for about 5 years now. He has slowly been tapering down over the last year, which is great. No pressure from me, I took him as he was so no issues there, I’m proud of his efforts no matter what. 

That said, he has no sex drive whatsoever. None. From my understanding, this stems from either prolonged opiate use or current sub use, so at this point there’s not really a light at the end of the tunnel. A healthy sex life is incredibly important to me and this is killing me. He is the first partner I’ve had after a 15 year sexless marriage, so it’s been a tough thing for me to try to overcome. I am incredibly sympathetic and I understand, but it’s also very difficult for me and I’m feeling like I’m at the end of my rope here. 

Is there anything that can be done to improve his sex drive while he’s on subs? I’d never ever ask him to stop taking them or force anything upon him, I don’t even really bring it up to him because I don’t want him to feel even worse than he already does about it so I am just really hoping there is something out there that can help him (and me!)

"Suboxone binding and blocking effect question. TLDR: Skip to bold.

Been on subs for 2 weeks. Actually think it’s not the best/right treatment for me (not cause of side effects ) I feel I’m actually not heavily addicted to opioids. While taking subs too it did make me feel a little not depressed but I got used to it. (Not heavily addicted I don’t feel withdrawl, subs are not for me). 

I do addiction counseling and have anxiety I get benzodiazepine for that. (Not trying to lose my prescription)

I had some terrible news, my vacation got canceled.

**How long would it take to feel a reasonable dose of oxycodone or any opioid**

**EDIT: 36 hrs is just the half life for HALF the dose to be eliminated, also wish it was subutex instead of suboxone. Naloxone makes a difference. I just don’t want to take a OC and feel nothing and get more upset, wish there was a way to check if it would effect me.**

Also, I occasionally take like 15mg(not very heavy) for discomfort. It’s long story why I had to be on subs 2 weeks ago.

Was originally planning on taking the real thing tomorrow but obviously that’s not happening. My concern is this - once I pass the home test, does anyone know how much longer norbup is positive for? Like what’s the half life of norbup? I can push the real test maybe a week, but more than that and I think they’ll be suspicious. Can anyone help with some info?",0,0,0,0,0,1
"Finally Finished w/ Suboxone. Alright. After almost 8 years of being on Suboxone, I am at a point in my life where I am ready to be totally done with it. For some reason Suboxone has always made me wake up with a nauseous or sour stomach and I hate it.

TL;DR - I’m down to .5mg a day of a strip in the morning for a week now. I think Wednesday I am going to cut down to .25mg, and about a week after that, probably hit it with the .125mg. 

Is this too fast? Too slow? I’m sorry this is truly my first time ready to quit Suboxone and (while I know it works for a lot of people) my doctor wants me on it for a long period of time.

About 2-3 years into being on subs, I was taking 3 Subutex a day. I was on probation, and I violated over having weed in my system. I had been on probation for 2 months maybe, and I quit smoking the day I started probation. So I was drug tested every week because of the THC, it was sent to a lab and they would say how much is in my system. So as long as it kept going down, I was good. Then one day at home I get a knock on the door from a regular looking dude. Yay for me, it was a cop serving a warrant, so I was arrested. I never smoked so I don’t know how it went up or if it even did. 

So I get to jail, and I’m not freaking out or anything, just figured I’d bond out and be good. Nope. No bond. No reason as to why. I wasn’t a flight risk. Anyways I spent 19 days in jail, and every day I was waiting for my withdrawal to hit. Day after day went by, nothing. On the 19th day I got out, went home, immediately took half a sub, and got insanely high.

I was please wanting some insight, and possibly any experiences.
Background is I had been using subs in strips for sometime. This is for pain management, as I have bone lesions growing on my spine. 
The subs worked well for my bone pain. 
I had chosen to come off this, because I had several other medical conditions. 
Plus I was also addicted to benzos and stimms.  While being dependent on subs.  
With the help of my doctor 👨‍⚕️ I did an inpatient treatment, and ketamine infusion for a week. Treatment has been successful so far, and I have not used benzos or stimms. 
I have another ketamine infusion booked for 02/09 earliest I could get in.
But my pain has become unbearable, I have had another bout of shingles and also covid.
I have tried some painkillers targin and oxy pills.  They don’t work very well.. 

I am wondering if a low dose of subs will get my dependence back in 15 days. Or give me withdrawals when I stop.
I won’t be using like anymore than needed and only  amount less than 1 mg per day. It’s not something I’m doing lightly.

And if you don't wait long enough or talk/smoke while the film is under your tongue then it's not going to be as effective.
    A great solution I've found is to stretch the film before putting it under your tongue. Yes stretch.

Is this a good way to taper? When i get off of it, will the withdrawals still be terrible?",0,0,1,0,1,0
"Does anyone use subutex/Suboxone for premature ejaculation?. I struggle with relationships and rarely get girls.Simce I've Selden touched a pretty girls arm in my life,and for whatever reason,first world reason,I've since puberty seemingly trained myself or at least been conditioned to get overexcited when being intimate with a girl and blow way to fast and it's just terribly shit and a cruel curse.Ive found opiates , specifically subutex,allows me to last alot longer and actually enjoy and look forward to the prospect of sex with trepidation.So I've been on and off subutex with this in mind,it's anti-depressant qualities notwithstanding.Is this a bad solution.Ive had people suggest SSRIs,but on them I don't really want sex at all I do know that subutex also reduces sex drive,albeit against my increased inclination due to being able to last longer,this reduction in sex drive seems to be not so significant.Particularly on doses like 4 mg or so.Im also on Wellbutrin.Any and all useful advice, experience or simply relating to this would be appreciated.Cheers",0,0,1,0,0,0

"How bad do you think WD will be from a TINY amount of Suboxone?. I’ve been on suboxone for about 4 years and have tapered down to a very small amount. I’m not even sure how to quantify it…basically I’ve been taking the smallest pinch possible with fingernails from a 2/.5mg strip for at least a couple years now. The one strip lasts me well over a month. I’ve just been content and haven’t really wanted to get over the mental hurdle of jumping completely off until now.

"Sublocade experiences? Was the end of the month difficult and how does it differ from Suboxone/Subutex? Pros and cons?. I’m about to get a Sublocade shot since I am just so sick of having to wake up and take suboxone every morning to be straight and I feel as though the shot would be more pro recovery for several obvious reasons. I’m wondering what has been other people’s experiences? 
My doc told me that the amount of buprenorphine a shot would deliver would be equivalent to 16-24mg of buprenorphine a day, but by the end of the month it starts to weaken. He also stated that if I try to do half a vial or something to make it equivalent to 8mg sub per day that by the end of the month I would begin going through withdrawal. So now I’m a bit concerned about going down this route. 
Is this true does it weaken by the end of the month so much that it’ll compel me to get subs to be straight? Any feedback will be greatly appreciated and thank you!",0,1,1,0,0,0

"Naloxone Absorbed Via Mouth Wound?. Hey,

This might sound borderline insane, but does anybody have any experience with or even an educated guess as to whether or not Naloxone can be absorbed into the bloodstream via a cut or wound in the mouth?

Had a dental extraction done a couple weeks ago. Within a few days, I start feeling some typical withdraw like symptoms - runny nose, watery eyes, ANXIETY, and strangest of all - diarrhea. I saw strange, because for the past 3 years, I haven’t had a loose stool. Not even close. I’ve had to battle constipation. So imagine my surprise when out it comes - as the joke goes, there was a race out of my bum and everyone was winning.

Taken individually, I wouldn’t think about Subs, but all together? The extraction site obviously is still forming new tissue and provides access to the bloodstream, to a degree, and the gums were pretty beat up in the process, and I’m thinking - is it possible that every time I take subs, I’m absorbing some Naloxone which is bumping some off the receptors, not causing full blown withdrawal, but almost like a mini taper of sorts. 

I can’t explain my symptoms otherwise, had it checked and there wasn’t an infection (my first thought), so now I’m at a loss; and the anxiety seems to be worsening, and the tummy troubles continuous for 3-4 days now.

I’m doing better (anxiety wise) . I’m really trying to plan out my taper.  28 days ago, I started tapering from 16mg. I was experiencing severe anxiety and panic attacks out of nowhere.
I’m  was put on lexapro during the same time.  

I have been on Suboxone for 3.5 years.
Due to fear that the Suboxone has not been at all helping the random anxiety/panic attacks or even causing it -I am tapering.
Even if not, I hate that I can’t just stop when I needed to and feel trapped on it. I used to love it :( .

I really am feeling better. Not 100 percent, but close.  

I’m taking a 10 day “vacation”  the first week of January to “jump”(the longest I can take). 

I’ve been reading a lot, but I really want to make sure 4 months is enough time before I put in for it. I want to alleviate PAWS as much as possible.

"Just taking more and more buprenorphine, stacking one dose onto another?. I've been on buprenorphine (without the naloxone) for about half a year.  It was prescribed for pain, not for opiate addiction (even though I have used opi's recreationally and been addicted in the past).  I used to get a nice high from it when I first started taking it, but of course that didn't last, as expected.  I know the saying goes with subs/bupe that ""less is more"" and that there is a ceiling to its effects.  I can concur with all of that in my limited experience with it.  But I also know that it's *possible* to OD on it, though not easy.  

So I'm curious what would happen if one were to just keep taking more bupe.  Like what would happen if a person were to just keep popping another 2mg every hour or two and kept doing that all day and night long?  Would there be any of the ""classic"" opi euphoria?  Would that person just get foggy, constipated, irritable, then nauseous and sick?

"6 months no suboxone 💓. Hello again friends. I’m coming up on 6 months no suboxone from a 2mg jump and I just wanted to give a short lil update. 

All physical & mental symptoms have subsided. I sleep well, I eat well, no depression or anxiety. Sometimes I feel unmotivated or exhausted - something I didn’t feel ON subs, but I can usually get out of the funk pretty easily nowadays. I remember to give myself grace and push myself when I can, and life is going to be fine. I just finally feel like me again, the good and the bad. I wake up everyday and do life, rinse and repeat. I often thought about suboxone almost everyday, not that I wanted to take it or anything - just that it was always on the back of my mind. How long it’s been since I’ve been off, how I’m feeling as a result of getting off, etc… and I don’t anymore. And that’s a blessing.💓

The first month was hard, the second got better but was still difficult, the third and fourth it got increasingly better. And now, I just finally feel great again and it’s such a relief to know that suboxone is a thing of my past. I encourage everyone to do what is best for them, getting off suboxone is possible if you make it possible - it can be done. And staying on is also a good choice - I am a supporter of both. Getting off suboxone felt like an unattainable goal for me, and I did it - and to be honest I didn’t think I could!

My plan is to get down to as low of a dose as possible before jumping. Probably .25 or half of that. I hear though that once you get below 4mg you're in a constant state of withdrawal, even if you're tapering. Is that true? 

Some people say just jumping off is easier than tapering. When should I expect to start feeling withdrawals? My plan was to stabilize for a month at each dose. My doctor said that should curb any withdrawal symptoms...anyhow...what do you guys think? Am I going to start feeling withdrawals once I dip below 4mg? Am I possibly going to feel them soon from jumping down from 4.5 to 4? 

I appreciate any help. Just wondering if it's better to just jump off instead of prolonging withdrawals....sorry if this post is scatter brained. A lot on my mind right now.",0,0,0,0,1,0

"Quick Taper Advice. First off, I want to wish everyone on this platform a Merry Christmas!

I put myself in a dilemma here and I desperately need advice. I have had three surgeries since 5/6/2021 and I have been on Suboxone for now 5 years and currently stable on 8 mg’s.

With the surgeries, I have had to go from 4mg’s pre-op to 16mg’s post surgery. And this cycle has happened 3 times and is making havoc on my emotional and physical state.

Long story short, with my last surgery, I was not able to taper at the pace my sub doctor required because my main goal was to get off this junk, but after three unsuccessful surgeries, my plan has taken a detour. 

Being on suboxone for 5 years, jumping up to 16mg’s after surgery doesn’t do a thing for pain, so this month around, I was scheduled to taper down to 6mg’s after being on 12 mg’s last month. 

Well I messed up. My next appointment is on 01/10 and I only have 32mg’s left. I kept on telling myself I would taper but I would experience stomach cramps and lack of sleep which kept me from tapering. 

Now I am in trouble…


Being accustomed to 8mg’s a day currently, my strategy is to take 4mg’s every other day until my appointment on 1/10 (16 days away with 32mg of sub left)

Is this a good strategy? Or will I be living in hell?

Please any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks everyone and Happy Holidays!",0,1,0,0,1,0

just feel like shit venting until my 11am appointment. If you look at my post history CVS refused to fill my script because it's telehealth.. even though I researched the referenced policy and that's about Cerebral and Done Health giving out Adderall and other stimulants it is not about subs... but whatever she is entitled to refuse scripts. Spent all day yesterday trying to find a pharmacy none would fill it and eventually found a brick and mortar local clinic who assured me they have patients at that pharmacy. Not like I can go anywhere else and I've already got CVS giftcards to cover most of the cost. Got a zoom call at 11 I'm glad I don't have to drive AN HOUR AND A HALF AWAY (which ain't really local CVS but they probably make more money somehow) hopefully this resolved the issue.

"[PLEASE HELP] Had 20 days sober, found pills in dresser and have used for 10 days. Best guess how long I need to wait to use subs again?. I feel super embarrassed writing this...mostly because my previous posts were full of confidence and wisdom from the 12 years sober I put together before my relapse 2 years ago...but after 20 days clean, I found a bunch of pills in my dresser from when I thought I lost a bag months ago.  

SO..I had used for 1 year (snorting 35 a day).  Got 20 days clean, and have now used about 3 pills a day for 10 days.  So using 10% of normal use for about 2 weeks.  I was still experiencing lingering WD symptoms such as low energy, no sleep, and being overly emotional...so I completely expect WD to hit me again.  It took me 74 hours before I could take suboxone to help.  How long might I assume it will take to use suboxone again?  

I am trying to guess if I need to be prepared to take 2 days off work..3 days..the whole week?  Or will this not be that bad and maybe just 24-48 hours?

I asked a doctor and their answer was absurdly stupid..""use the COWS system and take when you're in moderate to severe withdrawal.""  OK DOC..that would be 30 hours when it peaks.  You want me to take 2mg of suboxone at 30 hours? I'd want to KILL MYSELF I'd be in such horrible PWD. lol.  For me...I CAN ONLY tolerate subs when my withdrawal symptoms are at a low point on Day 4.  Any sooner and I get PWD.  I've got PWD at 50, 60, and 70 hours.

Anyone have a guess?  Anyone experience anything like this?  Have personally gone through this and know about how long it took after a few week relapse?

Going from 16 mg a day to 4mg. Hey so I’ve been taking 16 mg a day in one dose for the last 2.5 years. Sometimes I’ll skip two days and get a bit of a buzz.

"Journey/ day 2 jump. Good morning. This is my first post and I just wanted to say thank you. 
I’ve been in this life for about 10 years starting with oxy and ultimately leading to suboxone dependency. 
For the past 5 years, subs have helped me turn my life around and begin rebuilding a lot of the damage I had done. For that, I am forever grateful. 
I know what a wonderful drug suboxone can be and the countless lives it has saved. 
But I can’t help but feel that my journey to recovery will not be complete until I am no longer dependent on any substance. 
I began tapering down from 16mg about 6 months ago and had gotten down to about 1mg by the beginning of December. 
I moved pretty quickly down to .25-.125 for the past 10 days or so, and I am on day two of my “final” jump. No suboxone. 
Sleep was tough last night and have been feeling like overall shit since yesterday morning. 
Fortunately I have some time of work the next few weeks so I knew that it was now or never. 
I just wanted to thank everyone for their continued outpouring of support and shared experiences to inspire all of us going through this journey together. 
I know the worst is yet to come, I’ve been taking cbd and delta 8 thc which both seem to be helping somewhat. 
But I’m going to give this my best shot and stay strong! 
Will continue to follow up with my journey and I look forward to hearing from all of you that have been there before and/or are here now.

but my question is if anyone has had experience tapering with a clinics help, and if they prescribed medication to help with the taper? like the jumping off point not really the actual tapering i guess. i will probably talk to them about it eventually, but i just wanted to hear if anyone has experience with being prescribed something by their suboxone doctor to help them actually get off of it.",0,0,0,0,1,0

"The consequences of untreated pain. https://www.statnews.com/2022/04/12/underprescribing-opioids-can-also-cause-harm/



We've had discourse here on how addicts are not treated the same as non addicts when it comes to adequate treatment of pain. I felt like I signed up to be a test dummy after my spinal fusion L5S1.  I must have taken 7 different pain targeting drugs,,,, none opiods. I must have went thru 3 different types of rehabilitation. Then came the psychotropics. Who the hell prescribes psyche drugs for physical pain ?  Scared unqualified doctors who care more about what the CDC says about their patients than the actual patients themselves. Thats who.
Then came the L4 cirrhosis diagnosis. I though for sure a terminal illness would bring some pain relief. Wrong again. 
   When I see the high rates of deaths associated with the opiod crisis I always wonder how many were people in real pain seeking relief. Were they so desperate that they took a chance with that little blue pill that looks exactly like the real ones ?  Was the pain so bad they were willing to risk death ? 
  How much death was caused by doctors abandoning their patient's needs due to the 2016 CDC guidelines ?  Many of us here have long said the CDC actually fueled the fears in doctors and only made the opiod crisis worse. Not better.

Now we are seeing the harms  those 2016 guidelines  have been causing come to light.  Its a shame when we patients say it causes harm and are not believed. I guess  it only matters when a doctor says so.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"I need advice ASAP!. I will try to make this as compact as I can. I am a concerned Mother of an opiate addict. My son has been in and out of active addiction for about 9 years. Recently his prescribing buprenorphine doctor decides to just up and quit taking sub patients and keep his actual pain patients. He is a pain clinic doctor. That left my Son like a month to try to find another doctor before he runs outs of meds. We found out that his psychiatrist that he sees could prescribe to him so we make an appointment. When we mention the buprenorphine to psych he freaks out as he prescribes him a low dose of the benzodiazepine, Klonopin. He takes .5 mg three times a day. This is for panic attacks and also depression. He has been taking this combination of buprenorphine and Benzo for three years with no problems. None. He gives us two options. He will taper the benzos down to zero, then prescribe the buprenorphine or he will help to taper the buprenorphine. My Son was not ready for neither. Finally he chose the taper of buprenorphine. He started this on January 1st and it was a brutal 45 to 50 days. Well you probably know what comes next. He goes back to using. This goes on for a couple of days. He then tries to get back on track and then our family dog has to be put to sleep. That was a Monday.  Then on the eve of Valentine’s Day, my Son uses again and this time overdoses and we find out it is straight fentanyl that he got. I called the ambulance and we had to administer CPR as I had not got the naloxone yet to keep at our house. He was transported to the E R after receiving  a couple of doses of naloxone to revive him. When we get to ER I feel they were at least better about handling this type of situation than back 9 years ago. They did give us a primary doctor to see that can prescribe the buprenorphine to him. We have an appointment next week and my son is taking his  leftover buprenorphine to try to make it to appointment. We need to convince this doctor that we need the buprenorphine or my Son goes back to active addiction and the consequences of that.

I’m doing fine but I just feel like at any point I’m going to snap and become an alcoholic or turn to something else to change my brain. I finally told my doctor about how I was feeling even tho I’ve described these cravings to her in one of our first meetings after starting suboxone. Unfortunately this time she cornered me and said “ we need to increase your level of care if you want to stay on this medicine and work with us because of what you’re experiencing” she said I would either have to come in every week (I normally see her evedy 2-3 weeks and do urine testing, or I would have to switch to sublocade because somehow she thinks it would help my cravings more than suboxone, which makes no sense to me. My personal plan is to taper down from 8mg to a low dose that I actually feel. (I always see people say they’re cravings are way better on doses .25-1mg because of the norbupenorphine) I just want to know does sublocade help more than suboxone? Do you feel something off of it more than the strips? I imagine it would be harder because you lose the ability to take something everyday which for an addict is helpful and makes us feel better even if it’s just placebo to take something everyday, then to just get a shot 1x a month. 

Let me know what you guys think. I’m thinking about switching doctors. 

TL:DR my doc said I had to increase my level of care because I expressed I was having cravings to her and she said I either HAD TO see her once a week instead of once every 2-3 weeks, or switch to the sublocade shot (because it supposedly helps with cravings more) what do you guys think?",0,1,1,0,1,0

"Those of us that are diagnosed bi-polar. Please help me understand what’s happening.. I become full blown manic every time I dose. It comes on within an hour and lasts until I take my anti-psychotic medication at night. I dose around 8 pm (as soon as I can after work) and I’m off to the races. I become incredibly energetic, talkative, irritable, angry, depressed, flashes of suicidality, worst I feel I have potential for violence if triggered enough. My senses are heightened, I lose track of time. Hours pass without me noticing. I feel psychotic. 

I’m diagnosed bipolar II. So I’ve never had rapid cycling manic episodes before, but who knows what I have.. Everything is buried under so many meds. Seroquel, trazodone, and risperdone being the big three. (Also on Xanax, desvenlafaxine, atenolol and Clonodine). On my days off I sleep until the evening. Feels like I might be cycling.

I have a question about the Bernese method.  How much time is recommend between doses of sub with other opioids between ?

"TEVA GENERIC VS. NAME BRAND SUBOXONE TABLETS—which is better?. Today I went to the pharmacy to fill my suboxone script, the pharmacist told me that the name brand sub tablets would take a day to order in and I have the insurance for it so it’s no issue but, I didn’t want to wait (my addict brain thinking here) even though I have enough to last me until then. I told them to go ahead and fill me with the generic tabs and I just got prescribed the Amneal brand. Now I am wondering if I should have my script refilled for the name brands since I am getting reports of the generics putting people into withdraw. However, I am also getting reports that the Amneal brand is in fact better than the name brand. I would like to get some more info and feedback on your guys experiences with Amneal vs name brand in particular. And I’m not really sure I can return my script at this point but I’m hesitant to take any until I know for sure. 

EDIT: I have the AMNEAL brand, orange round pills with AN 415 printed on them. I’ll go ahead and try them this afternoon and let you guys know how it goes.

2nd EDIT: found out that the amneals are in fact a lot better than my old ones with the M/N8 on the pill. They last much much longer and don’t put me into withdraw after 12 hours like my old ones. I noticed the strips don’t last as long but definitely kick in harder than the both I’ve tried.

"2+ Months Post Jump. So I posted alot of reports during my jump from 0.5mg. I was on 8mg for about 2.5 years and over the course of 6-8 months I tapered down to 0.5mg. This is what I used for the jump.   
   
1mg Clonezapam - 2x a day (Morning and Night)
0.1mg Clonidine - 2-3x a day
300mg Lyrica - 2x a day  
Immodium (Lopermaid)
   
If you go back through my posts you'll see I had a fairly easy time. The helper meds took almost all symptoms away and all I experienced was fatigue. I only took the meds for 2.5 weeks except the Lyrica I ended up taking for almost 6 weeks. My pharmacy and doctor screwed up and refilled it twice before I put a stop to it. It's very addictive and was tough to speak up about it so be careful with it!    
    
So the update, I wanted to start by saying I think Suboxone is a great way to get off opiates. It helped me emensely. HOWEVER, now that I'm off it I see that it was definately effecting my life negatively and probably should have been stopped sooner then being on it 2.5 years. It's not like I feel completely different now, but I definately feel better. I feel like I'm less in a fog, that I'm more aware of my life and my decisions. I've already managed to lose 10lbs and have been sticking to. Ketogenic Diet that I wasn't ever able to do while on Suboxone. I have way less mood swings and especially don't get very low moods at night anymore. I was waking up every couple hours while on Suboxone and that has now completely dissapeared. Its taken until about 1.5 weeks ago but I can even fall asleep right away and then don't wake up until the morning. I don't have this anxiety about worrying about withdrawal anymore. I just generally feel better. Oh, and I know this doesn't make sense. But I was a chronic relapser while on Suboxone. Only ever going 2-4 months without having a couple days of using opiates. I'm now at 6months without a relapse and I haven't even been getting cravings anymore. Not sure what else to report but feel free to ask me anything. I was also able to stop taking the Proton Pump Inhibitor from horrible gas and bloating I would get while on Suboxone. That's completely been resolved.",0,0,1,1,1,0

Day 5...day 5 hit me like a ton of bricks. I was anxious. That rls. That feeling that i wanted to kick and punch everything to let the energy in my body out. That feeling when you literally want to claw down your face and rip yourself out of yourself. Sleep did not come as easy on day 5. 
 Day 6...its 2pm and after a resless night i woke with stomach cramps. I feel the Gaba helped but delayed some symptoms. To early to tell what the day will bring. But i feel ok. Im up. Im here. Im going to smoke out and watch the Bundy Tapes on Netflix. 
 If someone sees this thats holding on...one more day dude. Just suck it up and make it one more day. 
 Mind over matter i seen someone say a few days ok. Dont psych youself out.  Ive mentally jailed myself in my home. I though if i can detox in jail and ot not be bad i am strong enough. Im not weak.

Yesterday, day 5 off suboxone I proposed to her and we’re officially engaged! I’m so happy that I decided to quit and did this sober. 

I’ve been feeling better everyday. Still get a little sweaty and clammy, stomach is a little off, sleep is minimum. But the biggest bombshell for me was how much suboxone numbed me to everything. Even things I used to love to do I would just be going through the motions when I was on suboxone. It could be just me but in as little as five days off, everything is coming back to me. I have that passion again about my hobbies and life that I didn’t have on suboxone.

"1 YEAR SUBOXONE (relapse, update, and help?). Hey guys I had a lot of success on the suboxone program at my VA. I was able to stay sober for over year had a lot of success because I went to therapy once a week and was in AA, As the suboxone is just a tool for me in my sobriety. My normal is dose is 8mg/day.  About the 10th month in we did blood work and it did destroy my testosterone levels and even after getting on a low dose of testosterone, I still had these issues:

-still low sex drive and blood flow
-after about 5 months of subs, my emotions became ""flat"" , i felt like my personality was dimmed down
- wasnt excited about much of anything
-  My ex girlfriend ended up going with another guy and my testosterone and emotions were so messed up I just didn't really care

 I got very impatient with the VA because they take forever to help with anything so I came off the suboxone for about a week and guess what I relapsed, did 30mg oxy for about 6 days. I'm not being too hard on myself as I don't feel I threw everything away because the quality of my recovery was very high so I'm going to immediately jump back. 

I just took 4 mg of sub this morning, no PWD. Going back to work. I feel fine again.

Day two- totally fine and energized 
Day three still fine and energized

Day five sucked
Day six sucked

I was prescribed a decent dose of oxycodone for a couple years but my pcp who also wrote my benzo script of 20 years. I moved a few hours away and a few months later I found Kratom and told my doctor and said he could stop writing the oxy cause I had found a miracle plant....I couldn't have been more wrong.

It was not only so much harder/impossible for me to taper off...but the health effects. Awful gi issues, constantly- and have gotten
Much worse over time. If I didn't work from home I don't know how I'd work at an office. My hair which was so thick and curly was thin and brittle. I looked like I had aged so much and just felt awful. 

I made it 32 days without it and still wasn't sleeping more than 15 mins and had awful RLS. I wound up back on it about 14 months ago.  

Then I found poppy tea and thought ""this has at least got to switch it up and maybe if I'm quick I can ditch it all""...nope. But 6 months later I've got my hair skin and stomach (overall) back...


I finally brought it up to my doc yesterday and asked about subs and he said he was cool with me doing it with my anxiety meds but I needed to see someone else.

"Just Started Sub Pills, new to this need some...advice?. Hi, I am new to sub. I started almost a month ago & currently on 8mg. Started at 4mg. Prior was in a methadone clinic for 13 &1/2 yrs & quit cold turkey. Lasted 4 months and was dealing with PAWS & cravings & decided after long thought I'd better do this. 
I don't know if I'm on wrong dose? When I first started aside from physical side effects I felt okay. Now I'm feeling almost the same as I did on methadone and I am not liking this. I am tired all day, don't get much sleep at night. I stay nauseous and have to make myself eat. I am not having cravings anymore. I don't want to go any higher than 8mgs, really.

"Buprenorphine making me ill. Hi just a quick question to see if anyone can help or advise me what to do. I’ve been taking Buprenorphine for about 6 years now due to a painkiller addiction which started 4 or 5 years before that. I’m on 15 x 2mg each day and I’ve been taking 3 x 2mg tablets at 9am, 12pm, 2pm, 4pm and last ones at 7.30pm. I’ve done this routine for a while. 

A week and half ago I started feeling ill ie headaches, dizziness, lapse in concentration, restlessness, sleeping a lot ( 14 hrs a day ) and generally feeling sick. I’ve got the doctors next week but I was wondering if anyone knew why I’m feeling ill. I seem to get worse the more Buprenorphine I have in my system. I DO NOT take any other substances ( I’m not stupid ) I don’t even like taking paracetamol nowadays unless I really need too. 

Any advise or answers would be much appreciated.

EDIT - Thank you to each and every person who answered my query and gave a very insightful look at what I’m doing to myself. I’ll be cutting down to 20mg for a few days to a week and see how that goes first then take it from there on dropping lower over weeks/months till I feel comfortable with the amount I’m on and how overall I’m feeling on that last daily dosage I take.

"Managing Precipitated Withdrawals. Long story short, this is the second time I’ve had to deal with this hell, and God willing the last time.  Around the early 2000s I got off oxy by using subs and I never experienced PWs at all.  Clean for years and years until around 2018 and I got back into the dope game.  I caught myself fairly quickly last time, got a prescription for subs, waited 12 hours to induce and was immediately launched into the the worst hell I’ve ever experienced.  I’ve been through a couple combat tours in Iraq as an Infantryman and I’d take that over PWs any day.  Somehow, I managed to make it through and stabilized on subs, then weaned off those and was good to go until about a month ago when I slipped again like a dumbass.  I went back to the doc, got my sub script again, and this time waited 24 hours to be safe.  Well, fuck me if it didn’t throw me into PWs again.  I wasn’t able to make it through these though, went and copped and feel a little better 12 hours later, thank God.  My question is when should I begin taking subs again?  I have taken around 8mg over the last 12 hours (2mg at a time) and no relief could be found until I copped today.  Granted, I’m not high because the bupe has a higher affinity, but I do feel as if it has helped.  My goal is to get this shit behind me and get my sub regimen started but I’m scared to take more subs, even though now that the bupe has bound to my receptors, I should be able to continue taking small doses until I stabilize, even though I have supplemented with dope to soothe the hellish PWs, right?   I mean, with bupe in your system, even if you use, it can’t replace the bupe and so I shouldn’t start the PW train over if I does the subs still.  At least that’s what my research has led me to believe.  Anyone know from experience?

So  Ive been taking suboxone for a few weeks to get off of a fentanyl  habit. Ive gotten down to about 0.25mg a day, and didn't take anything  for 4 days. The weird part is on the 5th night, i got super restless.  Ive been taking a pretty good amount of gabapentin, and that didn't even  help. The restlessness only happens at night. Is this legit RLS or some  kind of fucked up extended withdrawal? Everything ive read tells me i  shouldn't feel any withdrawal. Restlessness is my only symptom as well.  No runny nose, yawning, cramps, pain, or chills. I was actually pretty  hungry last night. Anyway i took something between 0.25mg - 0.50mg and  the restlessness instantly went away and i fell asleep as good as i did  the past 4 nights. I know opiates are good for RLS so im just confused  as to what it might be. Anyone have some experience in this field that  can shed some light?

"For a friend: relapse on heroin after finish of long Suboxone taper, withdrawal symptoms..?.  Hi, I actually am posting this for a friend.

He had been on Suboxone (8mg), for 10 years... recently tapered off in this rehab over a long period of time, relapsed on heroin shortly after discharge and now is back in rehab, and going through heroin withdrawals.   


He doesn't want to go back on Suboxone.  Anyone know what he should expect in terms of withdrawal from the heroin he did - how long it might last, and how bad it might be?  If I'm not mistaken he was gone for about a week or two.  Also, he's still testing postiive for Suboxone, even though his last dose was weeks ago. I was unaware it had such a long halflife.

"Took suboxone once after 4 months off. Hi everyone,

This is my fist post here so please bear with me If anything goes against reddit traditional rules :)

4 Months ago I switched from suboxone to full opiates in order to to an ibogaine treatment in December (ibogaine doesn’t work well if the suboxone is still in your system)... Ever since the ibogaine, I’ve had very little sleep - but when I do, I have crazy real dreams, some of which I’ve learned aren’t actually dreams... sleep walking, texting, sleep eating etc. 

Today I woke up with an opened (and likely consumed) 4mg suboxone tab package. I have no recollection of taking it (and am mind blown as to how I found it, since I (thought) I got rid of all drugs. I’m very worried that I might get withdrawal but I know one dose normally wouldn’t do that. I was on subs for a year before coming off so I’m a little worried my brain might remember the dependence. 

Does anyone have experience with a similar issue or have a guess as to whether or not I’ll be back in WD in a few days? Appreciate all the input I can get.

Thanks in advance!

Sincerely, 
One worried as hell (ex) opiate addict

"168 hours (7 days) suboxone free🤘🏼. Sorry I didn’t update yesterday. I got distracted and haven’t been on here as much. Sometimes reddit gets overwhelming haha. 

**I first just want to quickly address those who are on suboxone maintenance or have just started:**

I’m sure you see more stories on here of people tapering  off subs and either are miserable now or don’t need it anymore in general rather than remaining on it. Suboxone is just ONE part of recovery. You became an addict for a reason. You abused drugs for one reason or another even if it started with a sports injury for example.  You NEED TO see some sort of therapist, group therapy and even a psychiatrist depending on whether you have other mental health issues like depression that you can get medicine for. There is just something in our brains that we are missing that made us miserable and drugs filled that void. But obviously, that’s not how we’re supposed to “fix” ourselves. However, you’ve taken a HUGE step to recovery and be proud of yourself!! Be proud of being able to take a life saving medication because you couldn’t be that addict on the street anymore. So while yes, many of us are tapering (or jumping which I never could have done lmao) because it’s kind of backfired on us. Suboxone isn’t working or helping us positively anymore. We’ve been there whether tapering or not. We get it. We can help you because of us being there regardless. You’ll get through this, too!


**My update:**

So as it says, 168 hours aka 7 days without suboxone and I’m doing fine! I don’t think my laziness or sleepiness has changed since I’ve stopped but I think my brain has a lot of adjusting to do still. Anyone ever feel bad for their brain? Lmao poor thing is on overload and chemically all over the place 😂. 

Of course, I’m proud of myself. It’s been very easy for me but that’s because, as I’ve said in all my updates, I went very slow and very low, I had really no symptoms. Whether the vitamin c has helped, I’m sure it has. I can’t say for sure cause I haven’t not drank it yet while at this stage. I did have some slight leg cramps and restless leg so I took a tiny tiny amount of Gabapentin and went to sleep. My stomach is still off but I’ve been dealing with they for like 2 months anyway so I’m fine with it.

I think the best thing to be able to say is that there’s no suboxone in me anymore or any opiate for that nagger. And really not drugs. I’m prescribed Xanax and Adderall but those are not abused. If you know my story, you know this was more of a doctors mistake (I’m not gonna go for malpractice because I can’t say for sure if I would’ve become an addict or not and it is what it is now) as to being put on suboxone but I admit to becoming addicted to it. 

I have zero cravings. I knew I wouldn’t have any. I was just really worried I’d wanna put a piece under my tongue but only because of it being part of my ritual for 4.5 years. I was trying to think of placebos and came up with orange tic tacs but turns out I didn’t need anything. But I’ve kind of so replaced it with vitamin c in some way. OCD sucks 😂. 

All in all, I’m doing fine. If you’re tapering or not, remember you kick ass and can get through it🤘🏼! I’m here if anyone needs to chat/has questions.",0,0,1,0,1,0

"Help & Advice on this Unique Dilemma PLS Help!. Hey guys 

So I’ve been on regular suboxone doses daily for like two months now, but last night I slipped and I used one street pill. I didn’t even feel anything and as soon as I did it I realized how stupid I was for doing it and wasting my progress. 

As far as returning to my suboxone doses, how should I proceed? Can I just take my suboxone as normal? I don’t need to do the whole 48+ hour detox thing right? One pill over the course of a few hours won’t cause me to have to restart the entire thing?  

I’m simply scared I’ll go into PWs if I take my sub dose so I wanted to ask you guys for advice or info. Online has nothing. I feel like since I didn’t get really high from it I’ll be okay? Gonna wait to hear from some of y’all first before I do anything.",0,1,0,1,0,0

"[Generic Subs Which are the best?]. I've been taking subs for about 10 months. To give a little background on me. I've suffered from chronic back pain for over 15 years. I've been taking opiates most of that time. About 10 months ago I told my doctor that I was getting cravings for more morphine thats when he said I have to either taper down or he can put me on suboxone.  I tried to taper but I was hit with high anxiety, jitters and I couldn't sleep. So I asked for the suboxone.

I'm on 16mg a day and it seems to be going ok. Except for some cravings here and there. I read on this forum that the Generic brand Dr. Reddys was one of the worst. 

That's the only one I get from Walgreens. So my question is which Generic brands are better and why?

"Suboxone and protection against getting sick. A personal story and looking for community feedback.. Hey everyone,

tldr: I’ve been on 4 MG since 01/2018 and haven’t been sick. Correlation or causally linked to suboxone?

I’ve been on suboxone since January of 2018 and haven’t gotten sick in the entire period. I mean regular sick, not dope sick.  I had sinus headaches a few times but nothing else. 

I recognize that I’ve had better habits and probably ate healthier than when I used, but I can’t help but think there is some sort of link. 

Covid Hits in 2020. So I haven’t gotten vaxxed but there have been times where I was in close contact with people a couple days or day before they got sick and tested positive for covid. I always tested negative. 

I wanted to put this question / observation out to the community and hear back from other people about the change or non-change in the frequency they got sick during their time on Suboxone. I don’t mean just covid, although I’m interested in people’s experience with that- but I would like to hear about illness in general. 

Lastly, I hope I don’t jinx myself by making this post. So I will just say, I’m fortunate to have good health and hope it continues.",0,0,1,0,0,0

Just in case ... 


So I’ve been on suboxone for awhile now and haven’t had any issues besides just wanting to finally be done with this crap. 
Last night some friends came into town and they HMU around 11 and asked if I wanted to play pool and have a few drinks. Ok, no problem. Well let me go back a few hours. After the kids got out of school, we got all the cousins together and swam and watched tv and mom and sis-in-law and I had a few drinks. They left around 8ish and then around 11 I went out. We had a few drinks and they decided they wanted to get a bottle and go hang out at the place they were staying.  Now by now it’s past one and my head is pounding! Red wine, tequila and crown and coke def don’t fucking mix ever... 
So we get to their place and I grabbed sum water (they got vodka and OJ and there was no way I could mix that. 
Then it happened ... “heeyyyyy guess what we have! Bitch we got beans from Miami! These are sooo good.. “  Just an FYI I’ve got vast knowledge of all things drug related especially psychedelics.. so I’m skeptical... why? Bc the shit now sucks ass! So I’m like “idk i don’t really want too but... “ 
Anyhow obviously I took it. Got SUPER HOT! In like 30 mins everyone’s feeling great and rolling around and I’m like “this blows my head hurts and no I don’t want u to touch me” I got up a few times and walked outside and shit and then after about an hour I just wanted to go home. I wasn’t feeling it and really just felt bad. 
I get home 2 mins later and started throwing up. I actually haven’t stopped!! I puked SO MUCH and my eyes just ran water out of them I was sweating super bad and freezing my ass off. Only time I felt anything is once I stood up after puking a shit ton and had to pee and realized everything was super blurry and shit. 
I usually take both subs around 6 but at 530 I was like god I need to take a sub but I only took one bc I had been puking all night. So I did and not a minute and a 1/2 later I puked again but fell asleep!! Woke up sick , definitely not rolling and I had to take my second bc I basically ruined my first one.
Anyhow yes I know the alcohol had something to do with it as well but I was seriously on deaths door for a few hours. I remember stumbling to the bathroom
to pee and had to grab the trash bc I was gunna puke and my stomach was not happy with me. 
I tried to look it up but I guess ppl aren’t as stupid as

"Difficulty with dosing after a week or so on full agonists. Hello. I just spent nine days in the hospital for a tricuspid valve replacement, and discontinued my suboxone for the procedure. Yesterday, we restarted my subs, and I'm having kind of a hard time. Been having *crazy* nausea and just don't feel good in general. Hoping to get some input here...

For reference, prior to surgery I was on a dose of 6mg once  daily. In the perioperative period, we used a multimodal pain plan consisting of continuous low-dose ketamine (10mg/h), 15mg oral oxycodone every three hours as needed, and very rarely .5mg IV hydromorphone for breakthrough pain. My pain was well-managed for the most part. 

Yesterday, I endured several hours without pain meds in order to successfully get back on my dose. I was offered 2mg at one and 4mg at five, but I only took 2mg each time, as I wasn't feeling super well and realized I'd want to take a full dose as scheduled this morning. Through the night I had terrible nausea, which subsided for a while in the wee hours but is currently quite awful.

Anyway, it seems the suboxone is causing the nausea, but I'm not sure why. Does my dose need an adjustment after this week? Anyone that's been in a similar situation, I'd be so grateful for your experience. Thanks for reading everyone.",0,1,1,0,0,0

"I'm New, Hi! I am on WAY too Much.. Hello All,

I was on a hardcore drug and finally got some help.  Long story short I went through 4 days of PW all the while being prescribed 32mg a day of Suboxone.  Today is day 11 of the 32mg suboxone.  I would say most of the withdrawals from the other drug are gone.

I don't want to be on this for years.  I know I can't just stop CT without consequences.  I've spent hours on this subreddit reading, and well - now I thought I'd ask for advice.

So guides say that due to saturation point, I could probably cut my daily use by 50% and barely feel it and the sub will still be effective.

Others say reduce by 25% every 10 days...

There is a lot of information.  I fought with every ounce of my life, locked in a motel room for 4 days, out of my goddamn mind, to get off my former DOC.  Instead of just skipping merrily along with 32mg a day, couldn't I start a taper now?

"Cut the Cord Update #3 (crap). Well guys I'm not gonna go on a long drawn out story here. Today on Day #9 around 4pm I cracked down and took just 4mg of sub and am surprisingly still feeling oddly good almost 6 hours later, yet disappointed I went back.

The reason why I jumped right off is because I don't want to go on one of these long term taper things ya know? I am proud of myself for attempting what I did this past week plus.

"Thrombosed hemmerhoid experience. Hello! So I’ve been on 16mg of suboxone for nearly 5 years now. I was up to 20mg while pregnant. I just delivered my 2nd baby last month. Last week I was struggling to use the bathroom and got a giant external thrombosed hemmerhoid. Something I did not know that could happen. Absolutely the most painful thing ever aside from giving birth. I had to go to the ER and have it lanced and 5 days later it’s still hurting so badly! 

I started taking miralax again. It never helped me in the past but my Doctor said to take 2 capfuls and that seems to do the job. Thinking maybe just a hefty capful could work too. I wish I would have gotten my bm under control a long time ago before I let my bottom get this bad. I’m 24 years old and have a scary butthole now. They are talking about banding or a hemorrhoidectomy in the future. As for now I have a giant ugly grape sized hemmerhoid hanging around praying it goes down very very soon. 

My advice is miralax, and glycerin suppositories. Please do not push this problem aside hoping it will just go away. It won’t. We have to poop. And it shouldn’t be a stressful experience every single time. Best of luck to you all.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Taper under 1mg . Intradose withdrawal ; stabilization ( myth?) dose timing ; and more!. Hello All . I just want to hear some other experiences navigating taper challenges under 1mg . Ever since I crossed 2mg I don’t feel as if I have “ stabilized “ at any dose . I spent 6 weeks to a month trying to stabilize at 1.5mg before moving on . Since then I have done two to three weeks at each drop ; roughly 20-25% at a time  . Currently at .5 for for 10 days and can’t seem to get adjusted . Symptoms include nausea, RLS , broken sleep, agitation , negative impact at work and personal relationship , total inability to be productive , lack of energy and motivation etc .

So far I have tried :
Am full .5 dose - result normal during the day ; things start to turn by 3pm ; miserable by 5-6 .. up at 3-4am for withdrawals.
Am .25 PM .25 - sick all day but sleep improves slightly 
Am .25 noon .125 evening .125 - same as previous. 

Basically I’m debating continuing the taper ; or just jumping if I can’t stabilize . I’m in no rush but if I jump I can be stabilize at 0 in 3/4 weeks vs . Months waiting to stabilize ( if at all ) at these lower doses .
The only benefit I can see to continuing the taper would be a total elimination of PAWS and while i know there is no guarantees , please share your experience with that also .
Many thanks to all who respond in advance.",0,0,1,0,1,0

The next week would be 1.5 one day then 1.75 again over a week.  And then so on until I'm done.  Is this a small enough amount to stop the anxiety?

"A cautionary tale against kratom and why it's worse than being on Suboxone. Let me preface this by saying that I used suboxone from 2006-2009 after a several year long addiction to oxycontin. I was clean for almost 7 years, then got hit by a car while crossing the street. I was back on prescription opiates for a few weeks, but not wanting to go back down that path again, I looked into pain relieving alternatives. That's when I found r/kratom. I then took kratom twice daily for almost two years and quickly became physically addicted to it.    

&nbsp;

My experience getting off of suboxone was quite honestly a cake walk. Once I got to 2mg, I spent almost a year tapering down to zero and once I jumped completely, I felt 100% normal. As such, after dozens of failed attempts to taper down on kratom, I found myself back here considering using suboxone to treat my kratom addiction.  


&nbsp;
 
That's when I started seeing an alarming trend: People that are at the end of their suboxone taper being recommended kratom. People that have been in treatment for a short time being told kratom is the better choice. People expressing interest in suboxone being told that they've got it all wrong, just get some kratom and you'll be happier for it. I personally got downvoted and all but called an absolute idiot for considering suboxone instead of kratom. I want to tell you guys why I think these recommendations are not only foolish, but downright counter-intuitive in relation to an addict that's trying to free themselves from their previous lifestyle.  
 
&nbsp;

First, let's talk about the common side effects of kratom vs Suboxone:  

&nbsp;

**Suboxone:**  
* Constipation  
* Diziness (at high doses)  
* Fatigue (at high doses)  
* Nausea (at high doses)  
* Physical withdrawal with missed doses  
* Urinary tract infections (in women)  

&nbsp;

**Kratom:**  
*(Please feel free to search any of these terms in r/quittingkratom to see how common they truly are)*   
* Constipation  
* Hairloss    
* Fatigue   
* Physical withdrawal with missed doses (this typically starts between 5-8 hours after last dose once you're physically dependent)  
* Difficulty urinating      
* Incontinence  
* Nausea  
* Dizziness    
* Vomiting   
* ""The wobbles"" also known as pressure behind the eyes and inability to focus your eyes)  
* Lowered testosterone  
* Adrenal fatigue  
* Difficulty sleeping 

&nbsp;

I will add that out of all of the side effects I have listed under kratom, I have experienced every single one (except lowered testosterone, I am a woman) personally almost every single day since I started. The worst ones are difficulty urinating (I can feel like my bladder is about to explode but be completely unable to pee for hours), hairloss (I lose clumps in the shower every single day and my eyebrows are falling out), and withdrawal between doses. I wake up every single morning with waterfalls of snot coming out of my nose, chills, achey joints, tears streaming down my face, and shortness of breath. That's just from sleeping through the night.  

&nbsp;
   
But the biggest reason I think kratom is a terrible choice for the people in this sub is that it gets you high. Why haven't I quit despite all of the side effects listed above? Because I am an addict, and even after almost two years of being on kratom, I still get high twice a day, every single day. Suboxone can get you high for the first few days that you take it, but as long as you're using it correctly, it just keeps you stable and craving free. Don't throw your treatment down the toilet by trading suboxone for something that gets you high.

&nbsp;

I hope that everyone will do their own research on what I have explained here. The reason you don't hear a lot of negative stuff about kratom is because r/kratom censors any negative comments or posts about the stuff because they're afraid it's going to be classified a schedule 1 substance. Some of them are also in the honeymoon phase of kratom abuse, where you've convinced yourself that you won't be like everyone else and you're experiencing few side effects. That will last a month, maybe two if you're lucky.  

&nbsp;

So please be careful and speak up when people are recommending addictive substances to people that are just trying to get their lives back on track. Coming off of suboxone doesn't have to be hard as long as you're smart with your taper and don't try to jump off at too high of a dose or taper down too fast. I am more than happy to talk about how I was able to come off of suboxone painlessly, just let me know if that's something you would like to read about. This post is already long enough.  

&nbsp;

**Edit:** A few of the responses claim that they still get ""high"" after months/ years of taking Suboxone. Not trying to be a dick here, but that isn't possible if you're taking the medication as prescribed. First of all, bupeprenorphine is only a partial agonist and has a high affinity but little intrinsic activity at the mu opioid receptors in the first place. Even with full agonist opioids, you would have to continually increase your dose to maintain the same effect on receptors over time. Kratom, on the other hand, has alkaloids that act as full agonists, similar to harder opiates like oxycodone, heroin, etc. Opiates will only continue getting you high over time if you increase the dose as your existing receptors become desensitized with repeated use.",0,0,1,1,0,0

"Quick MD. So I just wanted to share my experience with Quick MD because I know everyone is different so maybe my experience will help someone.
I logged on and was able to make an appointment for that same day. I paid $99. I filled out an intake form that basically asks how long and what you’ve been using. I had a video appointment with a doctor who was very kind and understanding. He sent me in a 1 week supply of suboxone which at my pharmacy in NJ I paid $50 for 7 8mg strips so a 30 day supply will be around $200 and that’s with my Good Rx card.
He also emailed me a prescription to get a drug test done at Labcorp. I have insurance so I don’t know yet if I’ll have to pay for the drug test but I did book my 1 week follow up appointment which was another $99. I’m sure everything varies depending on your state and whatnot but from my personal experience it’ll cost around $400 for 1 month of suboxone care. That’s not including if I receive a bill for the drug test if insurance doesn’t cover it. So yeah it can be expensive and it’ll be tough but if it’s going to help me stay clean it’s worth it",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Im on 40mg/day & very scared to have surgery next week. Im really scared and need advice. I've been on Suboxone for 10 years, prescribed 24mg/day but I take 32-40mg/day. (I'm new to this page so I'm just now realizing that I actually take an extremely high amount compared to other people) The reason for my post is that I'm having abdominal surgery next week and I'm terrified. I've read that patients who take bup are at significantly greater risk for respiratory depression/death while under anesthesia because they have to administer twice as much anesthesia meds to actually put you under. And IF the bup let's go of the receptors, all of that extra anesthesia medication that's in your system floods your opiate receptors all at once and you overdose on the table. And because of these significantly greater risks, you're supposed to make sure your anesthesiologist is specifically specialized in providing anesthesia to patients who are on buprenorophine. Long story short, I'm terrified to have surgery next week because I'd really rather not die on the table. And because my dose is so high, the surgeon didn't want to tapper me off before hand.

"Something I’m kind of ashamed to admit…. So I’ve been on subs for about nine months, and it has been great to finally be free from drugs and the lifestyle that comes with them. It even helped me quit drinking, which I had been trying (and failing miserably) to do for years. 

But it’s kinda taking a toll on me, because I still want to get high off of it, and doing things to increase its effects, and every once in a while stupidly taking more than I’m prescribed. The worst thing I’m doing is actively *trying* to get as little sleep as possible, only like ~3 hours a night, just because it’ll feel like I’m nodding off of it… and I’ve kept this up for far too long, and feel it’s affecting me both physically and cognitively at this point, and my sleep schedule is completely screwed by doing this, where I’m waking up at like 1am and staying up throughout the day. 

The last several days, I’ve been able to fight off the urge to wake up early, and just go back to sleep, but I’m still having to fight this sort of drug/high seeking nature, which I’d hoped would’ve been forced out of me by this point. At least I’m not willing to go off subs and go back to h/fent, I guess…

"I want to share this post suboxone story with yall.. So, while I have a few minutes, I wanted to take a minute to tell yall a little story to hopefully encourage yall!

7 years ago, around this time, I was a freshly medically retired Staff Sergeant in the Army. I was 29 at the time. The reason for this is because I cracked my L1 vertebrae in a airborne jump, then had a L5-S1 spinal fusion one year later. That started a very rough 6 years for me.

I was put on everything from Tylenol-3, Percocet, Oxycodone, Oxycontin, and Buprenorphine, just to name a few for pain management. It went from a necessity, to a dependence, to a full blown addiction. When pain pill restrictions got tighter, and I stopped getting my meds, I switched to Suboxone. It is a prescription that is supposed curb addiction and keep you from going into opiate withdrawal. This was from 2016 to 2019. Getting Suboxone was more stressful then it was worth, and more expensive to boot. I could have gone through the VA..but...no.

May 2019..I was out of shape, weighed 220 lbs, and was just not happy.

And then something happened. Call it, a wake-up call. My doctors office got shut down and I had 15 of my strips left. A safe taper takes months...MONTHS. I did it in 1 month. 

The withdrawals were horrible for that month. However, I bought a bike, starting going to the gym, and started working on bettering me. My first ride was in June of last year. A tiny 14 miler in 1 hour, 35 minutes. And it continued from there. I went from 220 to 200lbs in about 2 months. Until...the kidney stones....

All my progress was thwarted. All the extra activity sent my kidney stones into go mode. I ended up in the ER twice with bilateral kidney stones. I required two surgeries and was back on Percocet. When they were gone, I searched my house for Suboxone and found about 10. When I went through them and started to heal, I went through mild withdrawals again, I was back up to 220 and always..just..bleh.

Then the strangest thing happened. I won $3,500 at WInstar. I bought a new phone, headphones and bike. I biked until winter, then hit the gym for more biking. I was doing 30 miles in 70 minutes on the stationary. When the gyms starting closing, I braved the elements and hit the trail again. I am up to 48 miles in a little over 3 hours and am getting better with every ride. I am down to 190 lbs now and feel like I have life back!

I know its hard and its sucks. But I promise you, the storm will pass and you will feel better eventually. I had to work a full 50 hour week the day after I jumped from the tiniest, tiniest piece of Sub. It was brutal. I am so proud of where I am now though that I'd never even consider jumping back. I am now opiate free, fit, healthy, and loving life. Next is to start a new career. Babysteps.

"Maybe a more ‘specific’ taper question.

"Prior authorization struggles. Doctor will not do a thing.. Hi there!  
I’ve been on subutex for a few years now and have done well on it.  My doctor happily prescribes it.  My insurance recently switched and they are asking for a prior authorization.

"Pet safety and subs. I just thought I’d share this since I was just cutting films for the week and dropped 2 minuscule pieces. I’m super paranoid about dropping any and my pets accidentally eating one and dying, and I’m going to a wedding later and leaving them alone. Fortunately I found them so all good.
Advice- if you have subs or especially other opiates in your home with pets make sure that you have Narcan spray. You can totally Narcan a pet. Maybe they couldn’t even die from the amounts I’m dealing with now but it’s a fear of mine.
Edit: I’m hearing that Narcan won’t work for Suboxone and maybe my research skills were not up to par in this case. But caution, and vacuuming  if there’s any question of dropping some is good of course. But if one is still using now and then, with or without pets, it’s obviously good to have Narcan right on hand.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Heads up about being “compacted” (constipation). I am a 8 year Suboxone user and always fight constipation as most of us do.  I use stool softeners, laxatives, and suppositories right before I go without issue.

Well today was an almost near death experience.  My body must of built up a tolerance for these laxatives because I couldn’t pass the stool.   

I layed down on the bathroom floor and did an enema, still nothing.  I put my finger up there to try to pull it out, but it was so hard that only a piece came off.  (Sorry to be graphic).  

Laid down and did another enema and nothing.   I was petrified and was do at work in an hour.  I was embarrassingly about to call 911 or risk dying on the toilet from straining to much.  Finally after one BIG “child birth push” out came a bloody stool….literally a little smaller than a can of Pringles.   It was the best feeling off my life!!!

Long story short, BE CAREFUL on what you eat.   Cause eventually those stool softness/laxatives aren’t gonna work.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"What was your withdrawal timeline with a decent taper?. I have literally scoured this sub-reddit even with the Top-All Time setting, in order to find these metrics, timelines and experiences. Some good information, but very scattered. This has to be the most sought out information, and I hope to get some information not only for me but for those in the same predicament.

So, I will start with my experience but since I am one also looking for information, information from all those who are down the line and past my 8 days and such will be better suited to help others, i think.

\*I tapered 5-6 months from 16 mg cutting in half pretty much 1 or 2 months until i got to 1 and eventually jumped from like .3.

\-Days 1-5 were when the restlessness in the day were alive and well but mute, a lot of pacing with all the other flu like symptoms, both mute compared to hard opiates but still there, like 40ish% with the RLS and R Arm S rofl. Not to mention just feeling like i wanted to collapse with a weak body feeling.

Everyone knows the restlessness is the worst so that is kind of the sticking point for this thread.

\-Still for me, on day 8, at night the restlessness is still here and annoying as hell. Its not terrible at all, but just the fact that it arises at night makes it a pain to sleep.

I have noticed that gabapentin is a great medicine for this but FFS I don't want any other withdrawals so I am at that point where i just have to stop that since i am going on my like 6th dose of around 400mg per, all at night since days are mute and rather good now, just sweating and sneezing for me from day 6 to now day 8.

&#x200B;

If you want to include your experience with a jump higher, a jump cold turkey and stuff, please feel free to, I think would be helpful for people in that boat.

Here is my timeline-

1. Days 1-5 were when the restlessness in the day were alive and well with all the other flu like symptoms, both mute compared to hard opiates but still there, like 40ish% with the RLS and RAS (R Arm S rofl) or otherwise known at noodle body syndrome, which i just made up or someone else might have patented that... If i did not have gabapentin, nights would have been pretty bad, but i didn't take gabapentin the first couple days and that's how i know, but i did get 4-5 hours regardless, even without helper meds. But with it i slept great, but that's something that can lead to issues if you take it too long i believe.
2. Days 6-8 have actually been pretty much decent and great, not 100%, more like 85% with the nights still crappy but not extremely bad. I sweat during the day, notice my mind adjusting such as sadness that doesn't affect me since i know whats happening so i just shrug it off and do something i enjoy such as watch YouTube and enjoy sports news. But since i have gaba, i try to go without but end up waking up and saying screw it, i am taking it again since i am still under a week of taking it once per night, around 5 dosing occasions. I am at the point where i just have to not take it at least skipping a night or 2 since i DO NOT want to withdrawal ever again in my life from anything except caffeine.

&#x200B;

\*\*\****What has your timeline been, or what was your timeline when you did a good taper?***

***Since nights are the worst from what i have read the most from you guys, and I agree- When did your nights get better with the restlessness, especially from doing it the right way, a decent taper?***

&#x200B;

And what might be just egotistical, but i think is a wise move: for anyone getting sad and depressed through this late stage withdrawal. TRY and reconsider that sadness NOT as a depression, but more of a clear mind you now have that is clean of obstacles, basically just remind yourself that you are a tough individual and made it farther than most do, something to be proud of! Truly, if you can manage to convince yourself of the undeniable truth that you are improving your life going through this, it really can help you stave off the feeling of uncertainty, which is in your control if you want to harness it (easier said than done for some, but i wish you the best though).

"Withdrawal. So I was prescribed 16mg/day for a heavy Kratom use addiction/disorder. Quickly realized it was too much and backed it down to 2-4mg, insufflated (got the best bang for my buck). I have 3 drug tests coming up, the soonest is a little over 2 weeks, then October, and then this time next year. 12panel next year, unsure of the other 2. These could potentially effect my career, opportunity to move my family to a more desirable location with a larger house, etc..

So I quit two days ago. I’m struggling. I just got my Dr to prescribe 100mg gabapentin/ 3x day and .1 clonidineXR/ 2x a day. I also have Ativan, adderal, and propranolol. Needless to say I have 100s of 8mg subs- tabs and strips stocked away.

I have an amazing career that I’ve worked my ass off to get where I am and am desired at every agency I apply for.

"Holy hell I feel like crap today. Kind of a pointless post but just kind of journaling how horrible I feel today and maybe it will help someone. I've been trying to stop snorting my suboxone.

"Unstable from one day to the next on Suboxone - is this common?. **Super lengthy post** I always get really anxious about posting because I’m always afraid I’ll sound obnoxious or something but I’m at a point where I can’t go on any longer without addressing this problem.

For reference, I’ve been on Suboxone for ~3 years now; one year with a legal prescription as of this month. I am also on 300 mg of Wellbutrin however, I typically wind up biting them in half because they tend to make me anxious and jittery.  I am prescribed 8 mg of the Sub and I typically take 2 mg at a time a few hours apart. 


My issue is, some day’s I am so lethargic that I find it difficult to leave my bed.  It’s absolutely killing my social life and greatly affecting my relationship. I’m lucky enough that my husband is understanding but I’m sure his patience is wearing thin. However, some days I feel like a damn superhero! I get so many things done and I’m super talkative and excited; my husband’s even noticed and will say something like “I don’t think you’ve sat down all day.” 

I have not talked too extensively with my psychiatrist about this  because I don’t know if this is perhaps just a side effect of the medication itself and although she’s a really great, helpful and kind doctor, I find myself afraid to talk to her about this. I told her about how I’d felt super lethargic, unable to focus and/or complete almost any task and she just said, “I’ll double your Wellbutrin.” And sent me out the door. 

My question to you all is: have you felt this way? Do you know if is this common with long-term Suboxone use? If you’ve felt this way before and have figured out a way around it, what did you do differently? Do you prefer to take your dosage all at one time or do you split it up throughout the day? 

Ultimately, I am much better off than I was when I was using and I know that. I am very grateful to be on this program but if this is a common side effect, I’ll know whether or not I address it with my psychiatrist. Thank you all for bearing with me!

"How to combat depression from withdrawals?. Nearly 3 months ago I quit taking Subs cold turkey. Biggest regret of my life. I really wish I could have tapered, but I wasn't prescribed it and was being a dumbass. No way to taper now. Anyway, I was on 1-6mg a day for 2 and a half years, average of 4mg a day.

Physical withdrawals have gotten roughly 10% better. That's about it. What's gotten worse is my depression. This is very common when getting off subs obviously. But I've been sent into a \*terrible\* depression.

I was doing so good for myself before this. I had worked hard on my mental health for years. Got a job, have kept it for 2+ years. Started college and have a 4.0. Started saving money in case of an emergency. But now I am back to the bottom of the pit. It's like I tried so hard but in an instant all of my progress vanished.

What can I do to help the depression? Does anyone know precisely what Sub withdrawal does to the brain? I know it lowers dopamine which basically kills motivation. But are there any other chemicals like Serotonin that get affected? I'm wondering if I should get on an anti-depressant or a mood stabilizer or what.

Exercising and eating healthy doesn't help me, neither does the sunlight. It's the worst depression I've ever been in. I'm just grasping at straws at this point.",0,0,0,0,1,0

"Interesting tidbit I had missed on Sublocade...and any experiences with people stopping after 100mg dose?. So, I had been doing a bunch of research and was interested in sublocade. I must be one of the lucky ones, because I asked my Dr less than 3 weeks ago and their office already has the medication there and ready for me.

That said, I've been pretty excited to go in about 2 weeks for my injection. My only reservation/concern was actually that the 300mg might be TOO HIGH of a dose for me. I know I could be easily stable around ~4mg/day, and currently trying more around ~8mg...but I think starting the sublocade might be more like 16, and all day long.

Seems as though some of the blood plasma concentrations support that too, where average & low are close, but on high side some people have DOUBLE the bupe in their blood on sublocade vs 12mg subutex (and still significantly more than 24mg subutex).

This does not seem to bode well for tapering down.  But then I found this:

> **“After steady-state has been achieved (4-6 months), patients discontinuing SUBLOCADE may have detectable plasma levels of buprenorphine for twelve months or longer. “**

Wait, so...after I drop to the 100mg dose, if lets say after this initial 6 month approval is up I decide I want to come off...

I'm wondering if this means it may be possible to quit and allow the sublocade to slowly lower your blood plasma (because the depot doesn't fully dissolve in 30 days, more like 60 so I think you're still getting residual from previous months). 

Also the fact the say it will be detectable in plasma for TWELVE MONTHS or longer makes me especially question whether maybe these depots continue releasing a significantly lower dose for a much longer period than actually advertised.

So far, I've only found 1 person who had claimed to stopped--they were about 60 days post last 100mg shot and said they felt great. I wonder if withdrawal would still come, though. Or maybe the plasma reduces so slowly with this method that it makes coming off easy?

I don't know, and I think it probably needs to be studied significantly more.

TL;DR - Invidor says “After steady-state has been achieved (4-6 months), patients discontinuing SUBLOCADE may have detectable plasma levels of buprenorphine for twelve months or longer. “

WTF does that mean? How is it a depot that is supposedly releasing 30 days of meds going to still be in my blood a year later?",0,1,1,0,1,0

Third times a charm?. Right now I’m currently attempting a 3rd time to detox & go back on suboxone.

"Newbie - Weird side effects after taking daily 4mg. Hey y'all

Been lurking on this group for a while and reading peoples interesting stories/situations

I have one myself.  Been on 4mg for about 4 months now and past couple of weeks been having some strange side effects which come on after about 30 mins of taking my daily 4mg a day dosage.

it seems like after about 30 mins I start getting WD symptoms, cold hands, feet, nose, goosebumps and hot/cold flushes and sometimes stomach issues (cramps & the sh!ts) and anxiety.  Its weird as I was fine before.  Also I haven't change brand etc.  Even if I take another 2mg it seems to have no effect anymore.  Its like I am about to go into PWD but not full blown PWD ( i have experienced that before, NOT nice) thats the closest I can explain to how it feels

"Is it ""okay"" to stay on Suboxone?. Hello

I have been taking Suboxone since 2013. July 4th of that year was the last time I used the hard stuff, and the Sub has really helped me these past years.

At the moment, I am on 2mg per day. I've tried to ween off of it at least 10 times, but whenever I get down under 1mg or so, it's very rough. I can never find the 2 months or so needed to feel like shit and just get it out of my system.

The thing is - this small dose of Sub has been the only thing that works for my depression. I suffered severe depression from around 17 all the way up until I started taking Sub. I had tried 7 antidepressants throughout those years, none of them doing anything.

Also, my family doctor is fine keeping me on this dose, and says that he has a few patients that just live on it. The thing is, I can't tell if that is the pharmaceutical kickback talking. 

Anyway, is there anything wrong with living on 2mg of Sub per day? I have no major side effects, other than feeling a little groggy toward the end of the day. I live an otherwise healthy life, though I am pretty introverted. I think I am just introverted by nature though, not because of the Sub.

"About Day 6 or so of no suboxone.. I decided to stop taking it for about a week to try and drop my dosage drastically. I've often experimented with this and I noticed each time that the withdrawals lessened a bit each time.

Day 1 wasn't too bad, mainly just anxiety.

Day 2 is where things started to feel worse. My joints in my fingers, wrists, elbows, and knees always felt like I had to pop and crack them, my muscles felt sore.

Day 3 is where it seemed to be at its worst. I know a lot of people say that they don't experience peak withdrawals until a good week into detox, but this was when it felt absolutely horrible. My muscles felt pushed past their limit just by walking around a little bit, I couldn't sleep barely at all because of RLS, my skin felt hot and feverish, it just felt so bad that I wanted the day to hurry up and end already.

Day 4 felt mostly the same as Day 3 did up until around late afternoon when it felt like something clicked and my muscles still felt *sore* but not like they were screaming for me to just sit down already. I also noticed that I felt a bit more calm, could laugh at things, and I had a bit of an appetite.

Day 5 I still had some soreness in the legs but I noticed that it was much less noticeable. It mainly seems like my leg muscles wait until I'm about to go to sleep and suddenly feel anxious or tingly and make it hard to sleep. I was able to sleep at night a bit more but still not ideal. It's like I want it warm during the daytime but cold at night. I fell asleep by cranking the AC and picturing myself sleeping in a dark white room surrounded by fans and air conditioners with some rain outside. Haha.

Day 6 I noticed some soreness in my legs, but I don't feel like I have to try and massage them or loosen them up. It just feels like I spent a day walking around a theme park or something. I did manage to fall asleep for about 2.5 to 3 hours earlier and didn't wake up but maybe once. It seems like  the time between sleep disturbances is getting bigger. My skin doesn't have as much of a feverish heat to it either. It's still a bit hot at times, but not nearly as hot as it was.

I'm hoping since the soreness is lessening and the sleep disturbance is getting less frequent that it means I'm somehow on the downward slope, at least in terms of the physical withdrawal. If I feel even better by Day 7 I may just try stay off the suboxone.

EDIT: Soon after posting this suddenly something clicked again and I actually feel more or less normal now. I know withdrawal can come in waves, but I just feel like I normally do, but with a bit of a chill that creeps up every now and then. My legs don't really hurt anymore.

"Cut the Cord Update #2. Good Friday Eve Everyone.

I've been up restless for the past three hours and maybe have slept a total of 4hrs on and off since 9Pm last night. So in other words entering Day #6 today the withdrawal has entered the full blown stage. The one aspect of WD that has not hit yet is the bathroom trips, yet that's on deck cause my stomach is in complete twisted knots as of right now. We all know from either past detox attempts with both subs and active addiction how our bodies will react and what is coming. I won't make this too long here, but wanted to update my progress with you all. The first full day after starting I was at around a 2/10 in regards to feeling bad, but it's easily at a full blown 10 today. But, I'm going to keep pressing on and am sure I would have hit the physical much harsher by now if I was tapered off a low dose, rather I jumped off at 8mg. So that does definitely was able to hang onto the receptors quite a bit longer. So I know in the next few days the absolute worst is coming. I just wanted to take a moment out to thank all those who share their success stories it really helps with motivation that's for sure. Also to all of those who just generally comment well wishes thank you thank you and thank you. I'm going to lie back down for now, but will check back in today at some point.

Was able to get an appointment with quick md, it’s in an hour. Hopefully all will go well and by this afternoon I’ll feel like a normal person again. Send prayers and good vibes.

"Anyone here have any experience(s) taking Psilocybin (Magic Mushrooms) while on Subs?. I apologize for the random question. I'm still very new to subs, and have only been taking them since last Thurs / Fri to help get off of a VERY heavy 6 year Tianeptine habit. As soon as the subs started working I was just overwhelmed with emotion because it was such a relief. I had tried to get off Tia a thousand times using a thousand different drugs and methods, obviously to no avail. I'm actually somewhat worried by how good I feel 5 days in. Normally, on day 5 of WD'ing from Tia I would've been awake for 5 days straight and was just a shell of a person. 

Anyway, to my point. Well, I've had a dozen or so experiences with Psilocybin in the past while growing up, and every experience had a profoundly positive impact on my life. Even the 'bad trips' I'd have. In fact, the 'bad trips', although quite traumatic in the moment, were the ones that yielded the most 'knowledge' so to speak, through means of self reflection and viewing / interpreting things through a different lens / perspective.
I haven't been able to have any insightful experiences like this for over half a decade now. Tianeptine is an SSRE (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Enhancer), and since the molecular compound of Psilocybin is so similar to Serotonin, magic mushrooms had almost no effect whatsoever.

So here's my issue. I'm only 5 days into taking subs and there's a real possibility that this is all just in my head since I'm finally feeling better. But the way the subs have me feeling over these 5 days makes me think they might have a pretty intense impact on Serotonin, Norepinephrine, or Dopamine, in the same way that anti depressants might. I'm hoping that's not the case, because if it is then it's probably going to greatly diminish the effects as well.

Have any of you out there tried or taken psilocybin mushrooms while actively taking subs? What was your experience like, was it comparable to prior experiences when you weren't taking subs? 

A quick Google search of 'Suboxone and Seretonin' just brings up articles talking about people getting serotonin syndrome from Suboxone and what not, so it was no help. So I'll ask my fellow brothers and sisters out there of their personal experiences. Any information or experiences you guys would be kind enough to share, would be greatly, greatly appreciated.

"Why does 2mg give me more of a buzz than 8mg?. Was 7 days sober, used 1 pill last night to get some sleep bc I couldn't take the sleep deprivation any longer.

"Creativity. I don’t think it’s a secret or a select few of us that recognize that long term Suboxone use has dramatically (pun intended) zapped us of our creative spirit. 

I was (am, only in title/reputation) a professional theatre practitioner for the past almost 20 years. 

When I first started Suboxone, I noticed a dip in my creative output. Ideas weren’t fully realizing themselves, I lacked motivation, I found I couldn’t emotionally connect in the same ways I was used to.

I chalked this up the dysthymia, and to an extent I still do, but I can’t help but feel as though the Suboxone itself is as responsible  for the dysthymia as anything else.

In the years since I’ve been taking Suboxone, the above feelings (or lack thereof) have only become heavier and more intrusive. I used to be able to fight through the muck, but in the past couple years, I haven’t been able to muster anything.

I'm thinking the beginnings if withdrawal are coming but I'm not sure.

I'm scared. Switching 100mg to suboxone. 

What will happen?

Been clean 8 months straight. Used once the day after clinic kicked me. My sub doctor told me not to let that ruin my proud sobriety if I just keep not using.

"Will Suboxone provide me with pain relief throughout withdrawal and beyond?. I go through a gram of H every 3 days and deciding to come off of it. I did the kratom thing before and it only provides so much well being during withdrawal and beyond that their was something missing i feel.. How does it compare to kratom?

Secondly, is $350 / month + cost of medication a good price for treatment? I can't find anything less than $275/month . So it will be around $400 i would guess. I dont want to overpay for some posh treatment center if i dont have to. Sugestions? I am only looking for medication and not counseling

Lastly, should i find an addiction specialist doctor or just go through a suboxone treatment center or clinic? Do you guys have an addiction doctor to perscribe you suboxone or a suboxone clinic?",1,0,0,1,0,0
I am jumping off 6mgs a day. When should I expect to feel the worst? When will it get better?. I lost my job. I've been getting my medicine from a clinic that doses once a day. I've been on it at around 6mgs for about 5 years. Because they only give one dose a day I do not have a stock pile for tapering. I have nothing and no way to afford it. I skipped 3 days between my last 2 doses.  My last dose was 3 days ago. So far just feeling anxious. I've started the uncontrollable yawning and I can feel that terrible restlessness starting in my legs. I know things are about to get rough. I would like to hear from other people who have jumped from a high dose. How did your timeline go? When were things the worst? When did you start feeling better?

"Subutex 16mg- 1.5 years. Abdominal cramps/pain and now bloody stool. I’ve been on subutex now for alittle over a year and a half. Started at 16mg and am now down to 12.5 but think I should taper a lot quicker now due to my current issues. 

Awhile back, a year or so. I noticed increased bowel cramping.. which brought so much pain. I began being constipated all the time and gassy. I literally have a bowel movement twice a week. Anyways, it’s been going on for sometime now and has been getting increasingly worse. 

Never put the two together, thought I was dying from bowel cancer but never had any blood and was too scared to get checked out. Finally though earlier this week, I had a large poop that kinda hurt and I saw quite a bit of bright red blood. I immediately went to the ER.

They did blood tests and urine culture and everything came back clean. Then the doctor came in and sat me down and told me “Did no one ever tell you what buprenorphine does to your bowels?” And continues to explain that this most likely is the culprit. So long story short, I have a colonoscopy scheduled soon (I’m a 27m). Still pretty scared and hope it’s the subs.

"I inducted on subs yesterday. Took like 16 mg. But may use due to very mild WD.. So I inducted yesterday successfully after using pressed 30s for about a month. Probably 5 a day.

But some new places were telling me that costs have gone up. They were asking 400$ for initial visit and 200$ biweekly!

That seemed absolutely outrageous and it sort of made me scared that prices are going to start going up everywhere. I started thinking what would happen if prices went up like that -- I wouldn't be able to afford it and would have to withdraw cold turkey from 16mgs or so.

I've been wanting to start cutting back but just can't seem to do it. Can't see a way out of this. I hate paying so much. I've spent 5k+ since starting 2 years ago and it just makes me sick. I would probably stay on subs forever if they were free or dirt cheap.

"If you're new to Suboxone, do NOT let this happen to you!. About a year ago, I was taking Fent, and had been for several months. Maybe almost a year.

Decided to go on Suboxone for the first time. My method of taking fent was to crush, dissolve in water, and plug. It had been maybe 12 hours since my last fent dose when I got my 8mg/2mg Suboxone strips. I decided what could be the harm of also dissolving the Suboxone strip in water and plugging.

This was a huge, massive, horrible mistake. I can only theorize that using the oral method, the narcan is not efficiently absorbed. But plugging? VERY well absorbed. First of all, everything, and I mean everything got, uh, expelled within minutes. Like HARD. I'm not going to get graphic, but it was awful.

Secondly, I went into INSTANT, hardcore withdrawal. I was sweaty, miserable, and was even having some issues breathing. Worst of all, I had the single WORST case of restless leg syndrome I ever had, and it actually extended to my arms. It felt like I was swinging them around involuntarily. I must have looked completely insane.

I was carefully watching- if the breathing issues got too bad, I was going to go to the emergency room. After about three hours, I was back to normal-ish. Later the next day, I took a half of a strip as directed, and it helped me finally sleep.

"How much withdrawal would I get if I stopped .15 mg a day cold turkey?. So I have tapered down to .15 mg of buprenorphine (I am using diverted Subutex) from about 2 mg over the course of a couple years.  Before that I was heavily abusing poppy seed tea and loperamide before switching to high doses Kratom, which is what led me to start taking bupe.  I was stuck at about .4 mg a day for a long time, but I started using low to very low doses of naltrexone (.25 mg to about 1 mg per day), and that allowed me to continue lowering my dosage.  Most days I only take about .25 mg naltrexone, but if I don't work the next day and am able to sedate myself sometimes I take closer to 1 mg of naltrexone overnight.

First Generic my Pharm gave me was Mylan brand - I hated the taste but everything else seemed normal - But after maybe 3 months I started like having major flem in my throat - like a smoker who quit - I would be up every few nights caughing and hacking

Does anyone else have this type of experience with the Generic brands?

**I want to share my suboxone story the last 4-4.5 years so skip to the bottom if you want**

I shouldn’t have ever been put on suboxone. I went in to my doctor completely blind and didn’t know what suboxone even was. I can’t even say right now that I fully understand it. As I began suboxone Dec 16, 2014, it took maybe 2 months for me to go into a depression if you will. I refused to go out unless it was to see my psychiatrist (let’s call her Dr V) every month or go to the pharmacy to pickup my suboxone. As months went by, my hygiene went to hell. I admit to going a month without showering. I’ve said this before and I’m not ashamed of it. This was MY life, MY reality and how suboxone effected ME. So keep your comments to yourself on this subject. Because of my hygiene, I wouldn’t want to go out even more. I couldn’t get the energy to do it. I fell out of what my regular daily routine was. Every single day before suboxone, I’d shower, do my make up and hair and go out even if it was driving around listening to music alone. I couldn’t bear to stay in my house all day even if it was for an hour I was gone. 

Because I wouldn’t shower or go out, I’d call Dr V and reschedule my appointments last minute. I only had to see her once a month. It was a 40 minute drive. This happened multiple times until she’d had enough and discharged me as her patient. At the time she discharged me, I had been trying 6mg of suboxone but what she didn’t know since I hadn’t seen her was after a week or 2, I went back down to 4mg because I felt no different. Legally, she had to give me a month worth of suboxone so she wrote it out for 6mg. At this point which was a year or so being on suboxone, I thought I’d taper myself off with what I was given. I got myself down to 4mg and I was already addicted to it and I knew I couldn’t just stop cold turkey. I didn’t want to. I found a clinic where I didn’t have to go every day. I would be able to go bi-weekly. I had an appointment set with them for 11am. When I pulled in to the clinic, I was in the ghetto. I was by myself and I’m a tiny girl and was scared. It’s nothing against anyone there but it was scary. I remember it being pretty crowded. I had a hat on because my hair looked dirty and I sat down to a guy with a lime green 5c iPhone. My brother who passed away April 2014 had that phone and my mom was actually using it. I put my head down with my hat over my eyes and started tearing up because it was then that I felt my brother was with me and every thing would be ok. I remember waiting for my turn to give a urine sample and a dude that was 2 people ahead of me. He went and gave the front desk his sample and then asked if he could now go use the bathroom to go #2. I wanted to die. The bathroom turned out to be disgusting when r was my turn. I loaded toilet paper all over the seat and gave them my sample. I ended up waiting 2 hours. I sat in a seat with no one nearby and again, hat down and cried. I texted my dad saying how awful this was. How upset I was that this happened to my life. There were 2 guys going in to see the doctor after me. They asked what dose I was on and I said 4mg. They told me how hard it’s gonna be once I get to 2mg (really sweet of them to say at that time 🙄). When I saw the doctor, she couldn’t believe I was on such a LOW dose. Turns out I was on the lowest dose out of all her patients. She gave me s script for 4mg and said to come back in 2 weeks. I cried on my way home and sobbed to my mom when I got home. I called Dr V sobbing and after giving me a small lecture, she took me back. 

Things were going fine with Dr V. It wasn’t until I emailed her asking if she could give me a few more Xanax until I saw her in 3-4 days as I had ran out claiming that I had a lot of anxiety the last week. The reason I ran out early was because my mom is on Xanax too and we would take each other’s every so often and then both run out. I know that sounds like her and I eeee abusing Xanax but I can swear that was not it. I thought I’d just see what Dr V would sag as she tends to be generous. The exact response I got back from Dr V was, “Meghan, This is a real issue, we discussed you not taking more xanax then I am prescribing. I cannot give you more and we might have to discuss rehab if this pattern of behavior continues.” I immediately panicked. I saw her 4 days later and she had gotten the records from my pharmacy and saw I was even filling my Xanax early. She told me she was discharging me and that I’d either need to go to detox or an IOP. I walked out of her office crying my eyes out. Long story short, I found a new suboxone psychiatrist and both my mom and I agreed he was too good to be true. I canceled going to him too many times do he discharged me as his patient as well. He has NO plans to taper me from 2mg either. That was all I wanted. I went to an IOP and the only doctor who could prescribe suboxone dosed me down like 3 times and at 1-1.5mg said that was small enough and I was done and could stop. I knew he was wrong. As we got up to talk to my case manager, he said he’d meet me there as he forgot something. A bathroom was across from his office and when he wasn’t me in his office, I ran in. I cried and texted a few people. I walked out. I didn’t tell anyone. They called ONCE and left a voicemail. I didn’t call back. They never even bothered to try calling me again. 

I was able to call the psychiatrist I saw before going to IOP and he took me back. He put me on Nuvigil since I was constantly tired. I went to the pharmacy and they needed it to be pre authorized. I called the doctor and he answered but was annoyed. It took a few days to get it approved and I kept calling the doctor to hurry up. I didn’t care how much I would pay if insurance declined it. One night, he cursed at me. I told him to go duck himself and hung up. The next day or so, I called Dr V and told her what happened. She took me back and we immediately began my taper. That was all I had been wanting. I proved to her I was serious. I was always at my monthly appointments. She’s been so helpful and proud of me. My therapist has been the best thing ever. I don’t know if I’d be off suboxone without her. I didn’t know how bad I needed her until I decided to try her out. The only other thing that sucked was my teeth. They rotted from the suboxone strips and I did slow down my lack of taking care of them. $3200 later and I can smile without being embarrassed.

I know that was a long story and many of you may not have even read it and that’s fine lol. But I’ve gone through hell. I really have in just 4 years. I don’t doubt for s second that everyone in this subreddit has gone through it and probably worse. I shared my story because I know how hard it is being in suboxone if you don’t need it. But I also can’t express enough that suboxone is a life saving drug. No one should be ashamed to be on it whether it’s short term or long term. As long as you’re living your life drug free and clean, who cares! Anyone who judges deserves to be curb stomped. It’s better to be on this and live a regular life then ruining your life with getting drugs off the street that are getting worse every day and inclining the drug epidemic so incredibly high (no pun intended lmao). 

My biggest fear has been not taking it every morning with my other daily medicine. Today, I woke up more excited not to take it because I AM DONE! I made my choice to be done and it’s taken years to be ready. Even when tapering I’d tell everyone but mainly my therapist who has been with me since I started my taper, I don’t know how I’m going to do this. I needed my psychiatrist to keep me at a strict dose of it or I never would’ve begun my taper. No one wants to run out of suboxone so it pushed me to make sure I took the right dose every day. 

I’m sure I’ll feel shitty soon for hopefully only a week or two at max. But who knows. Plus the biodegradability of suboxone is half so I was likely taking more like 0.032mg. I hate this saying but it’s true... if I can do it, I swear you can. It takes time and determination but you can be where I now am. Hell, I was one of the people just a few weeks ago being jealous of everyone who was finally off it! Here I am and I actually am in tears because I never expected this. I also know I wouldn’t have done this without my brother watching over me and giving me the strength to keep going. I’m so blessed to have him as my guardian angel. 

If y’all want me to continue to update, I will. But if you get annoyed by updates, I won’t lmao. I’ll update in a week instead if you prefer. My DMs and chat is always open if you need a stranger who understands and won’t express, feel free to send me a message!

i don't want this whole post to be me explaining why im doing this at home without doctor supervision, so if i could just get feedback/thoughts/advice about my current situation i'd really appreciate it. 
my tolerance is equivalent to about 110-120mg of oxy a day. i waited until i was in full blown withdrawal, took 2mg of sub, waited 30 mins, took 2mg more, waited another 40 mins and took 2 more. felt pretty okay for awhile, definitely did not have pwd's. it's been about 7 hours, ive been mostly resting in bed but i started to have weird feelings with my heart (kinda withdrawal like, pounding,
and super anxious then sweating and crying. i just took another mg because it felt very withdrawal like but i am not sure if i made a mistake. i should mention that i am chronically ill and have many symptoms that feel like withdrawal (i know this from many years of not being on opiates while being sick). is it possible that i didn't take enough earlier and that i actually do need more than the initial 6mg i took earlier today? 
im also very sensitive to medicines and have been really nervous to try this for awhile now. i don't know if subs just take some fiddling around with dosages (if so, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated) or what i should be doing.

"Kratom and Suboxone.  

Hello, I am a 42 year old female and I was addicted to opiate pain pills for over 15 years. I have been on Buprenorphine (Suboxone) for four years now. I have not touched any alcohol or pain pills in 4 years. However, I do not feel satisfied. I haven't been able to find the joy in my hobbies and I'm really depressed and sometimes I wish I could just get high but I'm trying really hard to stay clean. I'm tired of feeling miserable. The Suboxone works and keeps the withdrawals at bay but I just don't feel fulfilled, happy, or motivated. I see all these other people who get clean and completely change their lives around and I've just gotten more shy and lazy and socially awkward.

I guess I should also mention that I have Borderline Personality Disorder and Bipolar Type II. I've been on meds for over 20 years and they only do so much. Right now I only take an antidepressant because I don't like mood stabilizers or anxiety pills.

"Bernese Method Question... need to dose 2x a day. Will I even have PWs? (experience answers only please). Ok... so I am trying to get to taking sub 2x a day. I keep getting scared of precipitated withdrawal. If I have a build up for 4mg I took the last 2 morning. About an hour or so after I take the sub I would take my DOC just enough to get rid of the small but shitty feeling from getting acclimated. Now I’m supposed to dose 2x a day but I can’t get a straight answer... can you really have precipitated withdrawal like 8 hours after using DOC. I don’t even really feel anything when I use it m, it just takes the edge off. Also I’m not using much maybe .1 of dope. To take away the edge. Either way today I am going to try and take a 2nd dose of maybe 2mg of sub as I have to do this to finish the Bernese Method. After I dose 2 days in a row 2x a day. I should be safe to stop the DOC and have super minimal shitty feelings from what I read. Anyone know? I can’t imagine if subs are covering 80% of my receptors that the dope (fent cut I’m sure) is even able to hang on to any receptors. So imo I wouldn’t think I would get PWs and if I do it should be very minimal... as this morning I used DOC at 8pm last night took my 3mg of sub this morning at 6am.. didn’t start to feel off for a few hours. Please any experienced people at this? Like I have heard people say if your on subs and use your doc you can take a sub even an hour later with no ill side effects cuz your brain is no longer dependent on your DOC as the sub stays in you so long it’s just building at the receptors. Thank you for any answers. I see a lot of people saying I will go into PWs, I just don’t think people get that I am using the Bernese method. If I had no sub I’m my system then yes the PWs would be terrible... but how terrible can they be if you already have sub in your system from the last couple days or would it even happen since I literally barley feel anything using my DOC an hour after my sub dose.

"For pain management?. I’ve been on suboxone for about 15 months. Started at 16mg/day for opioid dependency. During the 15 months, I’ve kinda fought the process and going back and forth with whether I want to be on them or not. 

About 8 months ago, I tried to quit cold turkey. After 4 days, I took 2mg. I didn’t even really feel a withdrawal to be honest, I just felt like it’s probably best to just take my meds like I should. But I worry about dependence so I started just taking 4mg 2x/day, cutting my dose in half within 4 days.

I’ve been talking to my doctor about the chronic pain and fibromyalgia pain I struggle with and he brought up that buprenorphine can be used for chronic pain as well. He said for pain it’s most effective when dosed 3x/day, so I’m guessing he meant it would bump me up to 12mg/day to start and increase if needed. Now my doctor is apart of a major hospital in the US and accepts insurance and everything so it’s not a clinic or anything. But part of me feels like he’s pushing more on me to keep me on the stuff forever. He’s probably just offering potential solutions.

I personally have never noticed any pain relief from my suboxone doses, even at 8mg 2x/day. I think the only time I’ve ever noticed any effect from my dose is when I first got prescribed and my first 2 doses made me feel kinda out of it. But maybe it’s because I’ve never taken it with the intention of pain relief?

I hadn’t really been getting restless legs anymore until last night. I smoked some weed to fall asleep and then woke up at 5:30 am with RLS and was like wtf? Has anyone else experienced this? Also wanted to put this out there in case someone else experiences it in the future and doesn’t know why! Oh the joys of being female lol.

One day I can wake up, brush my teeth, use an alcohol mouthwash, and dose (usually 2mg) and feel great.  My mood and energy will be elevated, and maybe even get a touch of euphoria.  I might get talkative and feel outgoing.  These are my favorite days.

However, on other days, I will follow the same routine but not get these results.  Some days it will be to a lesser extent, and other days it can leave me feeling down right shitty.  Headache, sleepiness, etc.

Now I suspect that it's a metabolism issue.  On the days I feel better I'm suspecting that my body has metabolized a decent amount of sub out of my body, but much less so on the days I feel poorly.  This is only a theory.

I’m new to subs and my therapist prescribed me 24MG of Subutex.  It’s been working great but I would get head nodding after my second dose during the evening, so after reading here, decided to go down to just 16MG of subutex a day so now I take one 8MG pill in the morning, and one at night.

The problem is, every morning after I take my 8MG pill, I’ll get sleepy in the afternoons and have to take a short nap.  It’s like the drowsiness suddenly hits me.

"What's really going on?. My husband was put on 6mg suboxone about a month ago. At his 2 week checkup the doctor didn't drug test him, but he admitted he tried to use once. Well fast forward 2 weeks later, I know he's still using. Money is going missing, I found foil in his car, he refuses to take a drug test. 

But I thought using while on suboxone would send you into withdrawals? I see him take it every morning so I know he is. Does he need a larger dose?

We are having a baby in 3 weeks and he says I don't have any right to be upset that he's still using because it ""doesn't effect him anymore"" but hundreds of dollars a week are going missing and I can't imagine he would keep buying if it did absolutely nothing. Is it possible to spit out the suboxone after it starts melting? Or any other way of counteracting the effects?

As of now he knows if he can't pass a drug test when I go into labor, he's not allowed to accompany me to the hospital.

"I would like to share my results with the mouthwash technique.. Hello everyone! So today was the day I decided to try out the original listerine mouth wash (the yellow, alcohol based shit) and I'm on board to tell you that it works. I was taking 14mgs every morning and was recently just using non alcoholic mouthwash before hand. I decided to make the switch to that nasty ass yellow mouth wash that's impossible to swish for a minute because it burns so bad and I have had great success. After rinsing my mouth with the mouthwash, I only had to take 8mg this morning and I feel completely fine. I should also mention I'm on other meds that make it hard for me to lower my dose because it will increase the side effects of those drugs (Vyvanse,  seroquel). I also took charge to not smoke or drink (and caffiene) anything after I woke up, as it can constrict blood vessels (20mins before and after medicine is dissolved and spit or swallowed)  I also popped the pill waaaay underneath my tongue. Like shoved er right in there. Way into the pocket under neath my tongue and relaxed. Try to not stir up saliva. So anyways guys, I just wanted to share my experience so that if you are either wanting to save money on buying pills or even putting this into your tapering method (like one day take 8mg with original listerine, next day take 8mg with non alcoholic listerine, then 3rd day take without any mouthwash and wash teeth and shit after medicine) I think would be a good way to help wean off the medicine.

"5 Days sub free!. Curious to see if any of you could give me some advice..
For context, I had previously abused oxy, vicodin, and pressed fentanyl “30s” for about two years. Like most addicts, I got tired of feeling like trash, blowing all my money, and having no overall care for my own well-being. I enrolled in a local MAT clinic and began using suboxone daily (4bup/1nax) for another year & 1/2. For the most part I had a good experience with the medicine, but decided to start my next chapter in recovery and put the subs down as well. I was able to taper down to under 1 mg.
Now, onto my coming down experience. Days 2-3 were the worst in terms of soreness and anxiety. Luckily I didn’t have the stomach issues that frequently come with stopping opioids. From that point forward my body has felt fine and I’ve even been able to get in the gym and complete some high rep work outs. What has really made this process most difficult is the insomnia/RLS. Obviously I’m still very early into this process, but the lack of sleep is driving me nuts. I’m exhausted, but my brain will not shut off. I was wondering if there may be any OTC remedies that could help with this. I’ve read that phosphorylated serine could be quite beneficial in comparison to Benadryl/Melatonin that could make the RLS worse. THC/CBD are also options, however cannabis has only provided me with a few hours of relief & then the benefits start to subside.

"Need 2 surgeries, questions about managing pain post op.. So i currently have a large umbilical hernia (11.9×11×7.7cm) that's over due to be repaired. Also having weight loss surgery after being on prednisone for 3 and a half years and gaining a bunch of weight. Anyway I have been on subs since Sept 2012 so almost 10 years, have weaned myself down to 4mg a day, my dr has me listed as a pain management patient, i was on oxys and percs and kept needing more and knew i was heading in a direction i knew would only lead to trouble so asked my dr to switch me to subs, the rest is history. The surgeons both know im on subs and medical marijuana as well as the stuff I take for the auto immune disease I have and managing its symptoms. Neither Dr has really addressed how they are going to manage my pain yet and it's honestly making me super anxious, I'm dragging my feet when it comes to scheduling either surgery mostly for this reason. For anyone who has had surgery while on some subs id love to hear what worked best for you. Also would be a huge plus if you also use marijuana, im not sure what to do about that either, if I need to I can stop using it, the subs im more worried about. I can also use edibles or something similar since I know inhaling it can cause coughing which after abdominal surgery I know will be painful. Just want to know if it's better to stop the subs prior to surgery and start taking another opoid short term till surgery pain is over? Or do I keep taking the subs and I guess they would use fentanyl or whatever at the time of surgery?",0,0,0,1,0,0
Teeth and gum sensitivity during withdrawals. I’m curious to hear if anybody else had experienced teeth and gum sensitivity when trying to taper or experiencing withdrawal symptoms from suboxone.

"Back to my old self'. I see this phrase, often in the context of detoxing from Suboxone and I wonder what it means for other people. ""Back to my old self"" for me would be craving opioids, like I've done since I first tried them at age 14. I did have 7 years abstinent with no cravings, which is amazing. But I lost that state, gradually, relapsed on hydrocodone and soon had a raging obsession with acquiring and using more narcotics.

I don't crave on Suboxone, so far anyway. I don't want to get back to ""normal"" since normal for me was a constant state of wanting to change the way I felt with drugs. At various times I've relied on hydrocodone, oxy, methadone, speed, weed, alcohol, muscle relaxers, benzos and kratom. That last was a truly ghastly drug for me. I'd rather be on Suboxone.

The second day of cold Turkey the withdrawals were too painful so I went to the ER. They gave me 24MG of Buprenorphine and that shit didn’t go away for like 4 days.

I’ve been clean off oxy for 21 days now and I’m happy I finally got off those devious pills.

"Suboxone and Cannabis. Hey guys,
With the legalization of cannabis for adult recreational use now a go for adults 21+ in 23 states, it begs a complicated question. There is a lot of evidence to support that smoking weed while on Suboxone doesn't have as many negative side effects as they say. A lot more clinics these days are ""THC friendly"" and won't fail you or kick you out for testing positive for THC so long as you come out negative for everything else. I know there is a lot of contraversy around mental health and whether someone getting clean off drugs should be smoking pot, but in my opinion you're still taking Suboxone, you're still taking a drug, and there is science that backs up positive interactions between cannabis and Suboxone, It helps reduce nausea, helps with the restlessness that can come with Suboxone, it helps as a sleep aid, pain reducer, anti anxiety, anti inflammatory, and that's just to start. Suboxone tends to make you feel like crap after you take it for a long time and honestly cannabis kind of helps with that crappy feeling, you can actually eat you don't feel sick to your stomach all the time. Everyone is different but I do believe there can be benefit to using cannabis while on opioids whether you're still using or trying to detox. The same can be said about Benzodiazapines",0,0,0,1,0,0

"Ultra Rapid Micro-induction?. Hey guys and gals, 

Its been a minute, I hope everyone has been staying safe and healthy. I have a question if anyone might have some insight on this topic...

So I relapsed for about 4 months now. Been on the ""blues."" Ive been wanting to get back on subs but it hasnt been easy...but after being sick over and over I am just going for it. I am doing a version of the ""berenese"" method, but since I am on a severely limited budget, I'm having to experiment...

I only had enough for 5 blues. So tonight, I cut an 8mg strip into .25mg increments and what ive been doing is taking one of those pieces every 2 hours or so. So in the last 12 hours ive dosed about 1.5mg of suboxone whilst smoking the blues as little as possible. No discomfort, just some mild sweating but its been ok so far. My question is this, when I run out of blues I should be up to about 6-8mg if timed correctly...am I going to be ok to just start taking subs after this or what??

This is the quickest induction ive heard of anyone doing, but it aeems to be okay. Will the bio have occupied enough receptors to replace the fent?? Prior to these 5 pills, I was sick as a dog and off the blues for the 2 previous days, so in a perfect world there wouldn't be too much fent in my system before this.

Anyone have any thoughts on this? As I approach the last couple pills I'm just praying that I'm gonna be ok to stay on subs, with no pwd. Please, for the love of god, tell me I'm good! Lol.

"GENERIC VS BRAND NAME - NEED HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS TO SOLVE ISSUE. How do you get name brand? I get them from an acquaintance who is on Medicaid but  recently started getting generics (Sandoz to be exact). They doesn't notice a difference and thus are not very motivated to push for brand name. We benefit from each other and now that she has been getting the generics and I have been having severe adverse reactions, I asked her to see about getting it changed since I am her only customer and we trade meds. What can be done and how can I explain it simply to her so that she can understand?

On my behest, she apparently asked her Dr. to change it back because she ""felt different"" but he said they're the same (unsurprisingly)...She also apparently asked the pharmacy about getting the brand name instead (I think the Dr. writes Suboxone on her script but she has Medicaid \[of course\] which won't pay the brand name willingly) and they told her that if she was able to pay for the brand name over the generics then the insurance company (Medicaid) would get suspicious of where she is getting this money to buy the brand name is coming from and cut her off. EDIT: It seems there might be some validity to this despite my initial reluctance to believe it. I still feel like maybe there would be a way around this so if anyone has any ADVICE, please sound off below.

Sorry for the digression but the point is, I need to find a way to effectively explain to her how to get brand name at the pharmacy and actually have the doctor do something about it. I am willing to pay 100% of the cost.... I can't speak to lack of pep or anything like that but the last time that I tried the Sandoz generic I got a HORRIBLE fucking headache. It was so freaking bad. And I have atrial fibrillation intermittently and Suboxone used to bother it all of the time but then suddenly stopped which was a miracle because that was a major issue that was preventing me from taking it/staying clean . Anyways, the Sandoz was also causing that issue with me. I literally NEED the brand name and I don't know what to do.

To this woman's credit, she has asked her friends for the brand name to trade or whatever but nobody is getting it anymore. (I have to assume this is because they're all on Medicaid but I'm sure even regular insurance companies don't want to have to pay for it if they can get you something cheaper.) So long story short, I don't know what to do...I'm about a week away from hanging in my car outside a clinic and asking people until I find someone that gets the brand name. (That sounds crazy and probably dangerous but this is where I'm at)...

I'd also like to note that I am probably only at 3mg a day. (I cut an 8mg strip into like 15 pieces and take one 3x a day.

I would just go get it myself but I am prescribed Xanax (which I also need to take once a day to prevent the onset of my heart issues when I am taking Suboxone so it is arguable even more important than the Sub and my psych will cut me off if he were to find out that I am taking Suboxone, let alone a recovering addict.

"How long before you feel sublingual relief of most/all symptoms?. This might be beating a dead horse, but I only found a few posts discussing the matter.

As someone who sniffed suboxone/subutex for like….12 years (yah I have a nose of steel, and it didn’t get fucked up til I snorted generic last year) I’m used to it kicking in and reaching full effect in a relatively fast 30-45 minutes, which is still kind of strange given the immediate nature of most insufflated drugs. 

Now when taking them orally I can’t tell if its a difference in when is the last time I ate, how dry my mouth is or what, but it seems to vary as to when I feel relief. Sometimes I’ll take my usual dose (a half a pill) and not really feel like I’m getting rid of all withdrawals and I’ll redose after like….2 hours….and then maybe 3-4 hours later feel like I’ve taken too much get a light nausea or drowsy. No doubt orally it takes longer to kick in but 3-4 hours seems a bit long for it to peak. 

And I know there is less absorption orally so even with 5.4mg zubsolv a half seems like alot in comparison to the crumbs that used to get me by sniffing (usually ~1mg) and taking close to a whole one at once will unnecessarily raise my tolerance.

Is my body just trying to get use to the subs or is this going to be an ongoing thing for awhile ?,0,0,1,0,0,0
3-5 day suboxone taper. Does anyone have any experience with a 3-5 day suboxone taper? I have been taking opiates consistently for a few months and tried to stop and couldn’t due to the withdrawals symptoms and having to work. I have been to inpatient rehabs where they did a 3-5 day suboxone taper and after I was done had no withdrawal symptoms at all!

"Genuinely Curious??. Okay so I was laying in bed last night and then I just had a random thought that I’m wondering if anyone can confirm or deny this. So anyways, you know how doctors or labs or anyone would have to test for bupe in your pee too see if it’s there? My thought was what if you had clean pee with 0 bupe in it. If you took a suboxone film or like half of one and let it dissolve in the pee cup, would the pee then test positive for bupe?? Honestly have no specific reason behind asking this, I’m just genuinely curious, kind of like a little experiment if anyone’s done that before. Let me know your thoughts!",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Using Kratom to jump off. If you use Kratom when getting off of suboxone are you just “transferring” the withdrawals? I would imagine you can use Kratom for a week or two and the withdrawals wouldn’t be that bad, but am I just prolonging my suboxone withdrawals or am I now with-drawling from Kratom. I jumped of subs about 2 weeks ago and have been attempting to use the Kratom to bypass the worst of the physiological effects.

Long term Suboxone. Hi... I'm new to Reddit.  I have been a Suboxone patient for 14 years. A heroin addict/opiate addict for 20 years. I have had the same Doctor the entire time. I was just wondering are there any other long term folks in here? Gotta be... I know its not the way it's designed.  But it saved my life. I also hit a sweet spot fir a few years where my insurance paid for it. It will now but only generic and I thought those were odd. Where I'm at it cost $235 for the prescription.  My appointment is always a $100. I used to go every other month and get 60 but they stopped that last year. I'm the longest running patient they have.  I had knee surgery today and they switched me to subtext for one week but I haven't taken any. Kinda makes me nervous.  Ok by I just wanted to share a little and ask if anyone else been on it that long. It works for me. My life is so different.  So good. I never wanna go back.,0,0,0,0,0,1

"Bupe.me question. I paid my registration fee 2 or 3 days ago, I talked with my provider this morning, and it's 9 hours later with no prescription when I was told it would be sent immediately!! How long does this take usually? I'm starting withdrawal and already been waiting on these people for nearly 3 days since sign up.

UPDATE: Finally got my script! Took about 28 hours after video meeting to receive script. For those who is wondering how long the whole process takes and thinking about signing up.. The whole process started Wednesday night/Thursday morning, my call/video meeting didnt come thru till saturday, and got my meds on sunday. So it's a 3 to 4 day process to get your first meds. My pharmacy called saying it was already filled and ready. So no issues on the pharmacy end of things at all. Just bupeMe is slowwww.. with that being said, I may search elsewhere while I have these meds to go to next time. BupeMe did come thru, but it's very last minute and they don't care if your in withdrawals or not. My advice is, if your wanting to use these guys then make sure you have enough subs for atleast 5 days already before signing up!",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Third Appt with my sub Dr. today- I am finally starting to feel like myself again:). I’ve also been doing the three weekly groups offered by my sub provider and they have been tremendously helpful. I don’t know if I would have made it without that support.

I have tried to ride this sub train before, but I have never been successful trying do it on my own at home, (just going to the dr., but still keeping it a secret and not getting any additional help). I have made it no more than 3 days the other times I’ve tried. 

The two main differences this time are that my husband knows I am on suboxone, and that I have been going to the groups (virtually online through Zoom). The fact that I don’t have to hide it is huge. The support form other genuine people who are going through the same thing, but are completely outside my circle (they’re from all over the US) has been incredible. 

And even though we are from all over the country, the groups are relatively small and we all have a chance to really get to know each other. I’ve gotten a couple really good suggestions through these groups aswell.

I’m so stoked to actually start participating in life again and feel productive. I have even let go of my pride and begun doing DoorDash. My thinking behind this is that I need to start contributing financially back to my family. My addiction cost us ALOT and on top of that, I also stopped working. 

I have a Masters degree and was top of my field before I let addiction come back in to my life almost a year and a half ago now. I haven’t worked steadily since then. Every time I do a job search, I see so many great opportunities, that I am qualified for, but being that I work in mental health, I don’t think it’s ethical right now to be in a position helping others. I am just beginning to help myself. 

I started doing DoorDash a few days ago and realize just how easy it is to bring in some income that my family can use right now. I am genuinely grateful to be able to do some thing right now to contribute. 

I know that when I have a little bit more time in sobriety I can return to my field and make more money. I will also be more experienced.😐

Actually, this whole circumstance has me thinking about possibly going into addictions.
Whereas I shied away from this population before, focusing mainly on child welfare and private counseling, I now see what a tremendous difference it makes to work with someone who is compassionate and understands.

"How fast can I taper off 3mg?. Hello all. 

I decided to ditch the oxy and try subs back in May. My oxy habit was 100-120mg a day and I was put on 4mg suboxone. I didn’t have any cravings or anything. I haven’t slipped even once. My provider moved me down to 3mg where I’ve been for a week. 

Total time on oxy: 2.5 years;
Total time on subs at 4mg: 1.5 months;
Total time on 3mg: 2 weeks;
Total time on subs: about two months;

For many reasons, I just want to taper off it entirely as soon as possible. My provider wants me on it for at least a year, but I don’t want to be.

I think that and the combination of just being sick and unable to do anything about it if I took more suboxone made a hell of a difference though. The only thing about me that isn’t level yet is my emotions and even those are starting to level out. I’m finally feeling like I’ll be off of this shit soon. 

I definitely would have been completely miserable if I didn’t have a shit ton of amazing weed, edibles and live rosin at my disposal.

"Off for two years, wanting back on. Anyone been off of bupe for one or two years and gotten back on bc of depression or some other reason?

"NEW anecdotal evidence of buprenorphine potentiation. So, I made a post on this sub about 2 months ago citing a study about potentiating buprenorphine ORALLY.
As most of us know, we take suboxone sublingually because it has poor bioavailability if swallowed. Well, after buying some ginger root extract along with milk thistle (source of silymarin), I decided to test the study on myself.
I’m incredibly happy to report that my subutex is now working for me how it use to years ago. What I mean by that is: it lasts all day without me thinking about it or feeling like I need to redose 8-10 hours later and half my dose is effective.
I had abused tianeptine prior to getting into OPT again recently for the 6th time in my life. I personally felt like the tia destroyed my opioid receptors (or perhaps increased my normal enzymes permanently) because no matter what the opioid nor the dose would affect me the way it used to years ago prior to tia abuse.

TL;DR
I took ginger root extract along with silymarin to inhibit CYP enzymes so that I can take buprenorphine orally and have the bioavailability better than sublingual or intranasal.

EDIT: after a few days of trial and error, IME, just taking 250mg of ginger root extract orally with my buprenorphine (oral/ swallowed as well) once a day has been incredibly sufficient. I didn’t care for the milk thistle (silymarin) combo; I thought it made me feel some negative side effects, albeit minimal.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"Hi, I finished my suboxone prescription 2 days early. Am I going to get in trouble with my doctor?. After having anxiety about this for the last week it seems that there is really only 1 thing I need to worry about and it's is confirmation testing.

So I guess my question really is:

Do most doctors use confirmation testing?

Is there anything I can do to help myself relax about this?

I have been using a prescription mouthwash called 'PerioGard' due to a tooth infection for the past week. If my doctor does use confirmation testing would it be possible to slip this in my visit as a possible reason for having a low count?

Thanks for anyway that can help

edit: I assume just relaxing and knowing that my test will come back positive should be good enough. My doctor actually specializes in infectious diseases like hepatitis and HIV, but he's the only doctor at my health facility with a license to prescribe suboxone (I'm native american) so I think since I am reading a lot into it and it's not a true blue pain clinic I should be OK for the most part.

I have actually had some med changes since then (trazadone instead of diazepam which sucks, omeprazole, and the mouthwash) So I probably have some decent excuses not to feel good to begin with. I don't feel like I am in withdrawal so that's a good sign too. Thanks everyone",1,0,1,0,0,0

"How do I withdrawal off fent replacing with a diff full agonist??. FULL details are below but I copped and then once more until my tooth pain went away. 
I tried to take my subs 14 hours later and put myself in a precipitated withdrawal so I went and got more to make it go away. It’s been about 3 weeks to 3.5 weeks of use daily. 

Now I’m so scared to even try my subs that I keep getting more just to avoid withdrawal at all costs. 
I have two kids, my dog, and I live with family. If i ever ran a day short on my meds someone would notice, so withdrawal off this fent shiz is not something I can cover up. Nor do I want to.  

I’ve seen the info about the Bernese method, but I’ve also seen that if you replace the fent with a different fill agonist like prescription oxycodone, morphine, etc that you can then induct onto your suboxone without having to fear the precipitated withdrawal ??? 

How does that work??? Do I have to take them for a certain time or can I just take them for a couple days then wait 24 hours and get back on my Suboxone?? 

I’ve been using now for about a month, literally only 2 days max in between uses. But I CAN NOT keep doing this. I was doing great and now I’m taking any money I have just to not experience any withdrawal I can. Being clean for almost 4 years, I can’t throw that all away.

SPECIFICS : 


Just recently I had the worst toothache of my life ( basically dentist wasn’t available, 2 ER visits did nothing) and I hadn’t slept in days. 
I couldn’t even take my suboxone because it was causing pain to my bottom lower teeth as well. I was on them for close to 4 years. 

I was going to get Percs to just help with the pain and like a stupidAs* I contacted my old dealer. Souly for the purpose of pain relief. 

I copped and then once more until the pain went away. 
I tried to take my subs 14 hours later and put myself in a precipitated withdrawal so I went and got more to make it go away. 
I did not realize how much this new fent lingers!! If I knew how long it would take for my subs to be safe to work again, I never would have used again. 

I thought I could get some pain relief and then just go back to life as normal as I’ve done in the past.

The total number of months ive done this is probably 13 months or so. 

Everyone told me not to do it but i never had the problems they told me id experience so my addict self tells me why should i stop? My life has been much better in this recent run of IV subs. I actually have a life unlike when i was homeless and broke on heroin. I can function so well and have desire to live. My life fucking sucks dick right now anyways, so many things out of my control, that the IV subs is the only thing I feel keeping me from relapsing.

"2 years clean off opioids. Suboxone saved my life.. 2 years ago on 05/27, a friend of mine took me to rehab after almost taking my life.

Withdrawals or a cold?. I haven’t been on subs more than 6 weeks and have tapered from 16 to currently between 3-4. I take gabapentin daily and have even before subs so the only issues I’ve had are pain and insomnia on occasion. I am now also on Wellbutrin and having a ton of anxiety so I upped my gaba dosage. Well today and yesterday I have this constant urge to sneeze and now today I feel mildly congested and a runny nose. I can’t tell if it’s a cold or sub withdrawal catching up with me. It’s more annoying than anything but since I thought the Wellbutrin was causing my anxiety I also now think if it’s sub tapering too fast it could be that too or instead. How do you all know if it’s withdrawal or just sick or not feeling good? As an addict I just never knew bc I always just took more drugs when I didn’t feel good.

"How much does Buprenorphine raise your hunger levels?. I’ve never been able to get a good reading on bupes ability to make me hungry for one reason or another, usually because of how I dose or what else I’m taking with it.

I still smoke bud which increases appetite, but I’ve been dry for a while, and notice sometimes like today, I’ll eat a pretty hearty meal of chicken and eggs and rice before taking my first dose day of the day (if I had dosed late the night prior I won’t dose first thing), and about an hour after ingesting, I’m pretty damn hungry…..

Now I also can’t strictly blame the bupe because I’m also taking testosterone and working out, which makes me pretty randomly hungry and forces me to restrict my meals or I could eat all fucking day. But I hafta be suspicious when I’m satiated from a large meal, then dose, then shortly after I feel hungry again…

"Anybody get neck tension/head pain on Zubsolv. Perhaps you’ve seen one of my recent posts praising the positives of Zubsolv, but I’ve found some possible setbacks.

About 5 days after starting I went to the doctor with a strange head pain. Not a headache, but every 5 minutes a sharp pain behind my left eye at the temple. I went to bed early and woke up and to my surprise it was still happening. 

I had taken zubsolv for about 6 months 4 years ago and didn’t notice any issues…

Another definite correlation I didn’t notice is about 30 minutes after dosing my neck gets uncomfortably tense…

I noticed it gaming during high intensity FPS like Halo or Fortnite or PUBG, and chalked it up to being tense from gaming…but after another week I noticed it even while lying down…

"Cold turkey. Just looking for some insight or experience with a certain situation im in.

Some background, started using opioids around 6 years ago, started off with tramadol, worked my up to oxys (200-300 mg/day). Managed to get off that but only lasted a few weeks before I found myself right back at it. This time with Methadone tho (not prescribed), at my worst I was taking upto 300mgs daily...managed to wean to a low-ish dose (60 maybe) then jumped. Again, lasted a few weeks till I was back. The one thing I did differently this time was start Suboxone as soon as I could, ive had a few episodes of PWD from dosing too soon but this time things went smoothly.

Now I've been on subs for about a year now. I dont really have a fixed dose; I take anywhere from 1.5 to 14mgs daily, but my aver would sit at say 5mg daily.

6 days ago I tried something new (new for me at least). I took around 24mgs as a single dose...my reasoning was that since Bupe has such a long half life it would bring me down slowly enough for my body to adjust untill there was nothing left in my system.

What I dont get is that so far haven't had any withdrawals...maybe a chill here and there, little bit of anxiety occasionally. I know bupe withdrawal takes longer to kick in, but after 6 days shouldnt I be feeling much worse? I dont know if the high loading dose actually worked, or of it just delayed what's coming.

"Having sudden side effects after years on sub. This is a fairly long post, but I am in desperate need of help and I could really use some feedback about this situation. Thank you in advance for anyone that is willing to take the time to read this and give me some input. 

I've been on Suboxone/Subutex for about 5 years. Besides minor headaches (reason for switching to Subutex) I've always reacted extremely well to bupe. My morning dose gives me a surge of energy and makes me productive and personable at work. As much as I love opiates, subs have always made me feel more 'myself' than any other drug. 

Unfortunately, everything changed last week. I took my morning dose (about 2mg) and started feeling very strange about a half hour later. I felt sort of dizzy and my stomach started to turn. Before long, I was extremely nauseous and clammy, and I started puking. The dizziness and nausea lasted for hours, and I also became uncontrollably sleepy, like full-on nodding off. 

When this first happened, I convinced myself that it must have been dehydration. I did not take my 2nd dose that day, so I woke up in withdrawal the next morning. Thinking nothing of the day before, I took my dose like normal. Sure enough.. same dizzy nauseous feeling came right back. 

This has continued for the past week. I've been researching and trying different things to resolve it, but nothing has worked. I've been spitting out the excess meds after taking my dose instead of swallowing, which only makes me feel slightly better, but its clear that I am not ingesting the same dose as before, so I don't feel like I got the full effect. 

I'm really feeling hopeless about this situation. My work performance has been poor, and I just can't function in general. I have lowered my dose to the bare minimum that it will take me to not be sick, since taking the full dose makes me sick in a different way.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? I could go into more detail, but I don't want this post to be insanely long. Here are a few other things that should be taken into account: 

I've been on a 'keto' diet for the past few months. Little to no carbs, lots of meat and fat in my diet. I've been fairly 'backed up' recently, and I thought that may have been the issue, since I read that constipation can cause some of the symptoms I've been having. However, without going into too much detail, I was able to clear out my system on Sunday, and I am still having the same issues. 

I usually do feel dehydrated, but this has been pretty consistent throughout my time on subs. I've made it a real point to hydrate like crazy since this started happening, so I don't think that is the problem.

"Suboxone taper plan 2 years. I have been very worried about my doctors taper plan for me and I want to get some advice whether not I should be concerned. He started me on 8mgs and wants to taper me over a period of two years. I had a 200mg IV heroin habit that was getting worse. However,  the first dose of 8mgs knocked me off my feet. I took soboxone a few times 7 years ago so I knew it was strong and asked the doctor to start me on 2mgs and he said 8. I took my first 8 about a week ago and immediately knew it was too much. The 2nd day I took none than attempted to adjust my dose on my own to about 2-4mgs. At first my doctor told me to stay on 8 but 2 days ago I convinced him that if he would not allow me to take less I was not willing to continue treatment for fear of addiction. He agreed. What sucks is I already took the initial 8 and I had a small taste of the withdrawl and it SUCKED. Im getting more miles on this than H as far as painkilling goes( not euphoria miles ). Here is my question,  will it be real hard to get off 8mgs in 2 years? I hear a variety of answers but im just scared that the doctor only knows theory and may worsen my addiction with this. I don't mind taking it knowing I can get off one day but this stuff is no joke strong. I'm worried ill dig myself a hole I can't get out of. July 4th was my first dose and since then I have taken a total of about 22mgs. I'm noticing it becoming harder to stick to my 2 or 4 mg and may have to go up to eight since my first dose inducted me hard af unfortunately. Any suggestions?

I feel like I should go out and do something but that I also need some sleep but every time im laying down or close my eyes everything starts spinning and I just dont feel right.

Ive been on Espranor for over 2 months, and when ive been taking it consistentlly at the same time this hasnt happened, but last week I changed the time I took it and 3 days ago I also completely missed a days dose.. could this be why?

Has anyone every experienced anything like this before?

I genuinly at times am feeling so dizzy and like something must be seriously wrong like everything is just going to start spinning out of control, and it sends me into having a panic attack aswell... but if I go to the hospital Ill be waiitng in Accident emergency for hours anyway and after a few hours it might pass...",0,0,1,1,0,0

"6 months sub free…you can do it!. It’s been almost 6 months since I tapered off Suboxone and wanted to spread some hope for those thinking about tapering or have recently jumped.

I tapered down to .25mg/day for two weeks before I jumped, and barely had withdrawals. Mentally I felt so much better only a week or so after the jump. Had some minor sleep disturbances and sweating/chills days 4-7, but that was it! I tried to jump off 2mg a few months before that and for me, that was a terrible idea. Went back on it after about 30 days and tapered much lower. Best decision I ever made. 

I started at 8mg a year and a half before and once I got down to 2mg, I made sure to finish the taper out long. At 2mg I started alternating days of 2mg then 1mg, then 2 days 1mg and 1 day 2mg, and so on. I stayed at .75, .5, and .25 each for two weeks.

"This might be a stupid question but.... I've been on suboxone for going on 4 years now due to opiates addiction, but it's now come the time where I have to start weaning off and I'm terrified. I'm excited to finally not be trapped by any sort of medication like I have been for the last 10 - 12 years of my life. And I'm only 28. 

My question is this; since suboxone has such a long half life, would that make for a tough taper? I know people are saying a long half life is actually *good* for tapering, but is it? If I had access to a bunch of hydrocodone pills, do you think it might be easier to just take some weak short acting opiates at the end? I don't think I'll have any problem doing that because of my current mindset, and also because they're just lortabs lol not like I'm shooting up 5 bags of heroin ya know? 

I just had the thought that maybe the withdrawl would be quicker in a sense if I were to just take some 10mg hydrocodone pills at the end. Since they're short acting, I could get the withdrawls over with quicker. In theory. Right? 

Or is this a terrible idea? I know the obvious answer to that question XD but when it comes to self control and all that, I'm not worried about it. I have the mindset now, I actually *want* to be off drugs, and I enjoy being sober now. So I'm not worried about any of that as long I don't touch a needle, and I never will again.

"40 days off suboxone. 40 days off suboxone 

Just wanted to add some (mostly) positivity to the pot here. I’ve been reading through these subreddits the past couple of months and it’s helped immensely in feeling not alone in this. 

A short background: got hooked on Oxy’s almost 4 years ago after having over a year of clean time. Ended up getting in deeper than I had before (I had been more of a weekender popping pills and doing coke before the last run). Anyways, couldn’t afford the habit anymore so a hookup/buddy started selling me some his subs and I was pretty naive about what they were at the time. I just knew they helped me feel ‘normal’ and I could make a pill last several days as opposed to blowing through several Oxys a day. Little did I know this would become an even bigger monkey on my back. So after months of scoring subs off the street I finally got a doc and of course he prescribed me like 4x what I had been taking. I was soon taking 12 mg a day with a doc that had no interest in getting me off. He likened it to being my ‘insulin’ now. I had fucked my brain up according to him and would never be normal again. 

But I didn’t feel ‘normal’ on subs after a while. I didn’t like having to take something in the morning to just function like everybody else in the world. And I was starting to get side effects like a non existent sex drive, bad anxiety, mood swings that were all affecting the relationships in my life. I almost became a recluse. I tried tapering on my own but it seemed impossible. I now know I was going to fast. I was scared, terrified I’d be on this shit forever. 

I finally found another doctor over a year ago who helped me start a slow taper. Now, I had a stash of extra subs set aside that helped me through the jumps. He basically dropped me 2 mg at a time until we hit 2 mg. I did not follow this exactly. I went much more gradually using my extra subs to bridge the 2 mg drops. I wrote down what I took and when I took it religiously in a notebook for well over a year. I can’t recommend this enough as it will help show your progress the times when you feel stuck. And keep you accountable. At 1 mg I couldn’t stabilize. I read about other people having this issue. I had felt BAD the last several months. Hot flashes, mood swings, anxiety. I had put a few holes in the wall fighting with my girlfriend. I couldn’t take another several months of tapering. And when I started taking more than the 1 mg again to get me through that’s when I made the decision...I jumped. 

Now 1 mg is still a pretty significant dose. I’ve heard people here jumping from way higher but also much, much lower. I’m a pretty sensitive individual, strong minded but fairly sensitive to pain. I can tell you confidently if I can do this, you can too! Sub withdrawal is a mental battle. The first 10 days were the worst physically by far. The fatigue was crippling. I could barely stand the first week. The next couple weeks the pain relented slightly but the depression kicks in. It’s a battle. Looking back I feel SO much better on day 40 then I did at day 2 or 3 but it’s so slow it’s almost imperceptible. I still get anxiety, still have stomach issues, still feel my skin crawling when I wake up. It’s uncomfortable but it’s tolerable now. It comes in waves and I have moments in the day when I feel like myself again and moments when I ask when will this end!?? But I keep putting one foot in front of the other. I know I’m through the worst of it now and even if I have to feel bad for a couple more months, it’s a price to pay for freedom. 

As far as supplements that have helped:

Chlonidine: really does take the edge off, especially when you’re past the worst of the acute symptoms. Mostly took it at night. 

Kratom: this can be a crutch and easily turn into another addiction if you let it so...BE CAREFUL. I used larger doses (5-9grm) once to twice a day to get some relief during the first 10 days. After that I dropped to once a day and kept dropping down till I was maybe taking 2-3 grams in the morning and was able to jump off it relatively easily after a few weeks. Key was really spacing doses out 12 to 24 hours so my body/brain didn’t get used to it and I could continue healing 

Ashwaganda: started taking this a week ago and it’s really helped return my sleep cycle to almost back to normal. 

DLPA: been taking since I jumped and think it might have helped a bit with the depression, no way of really knowing I guess.

From the above article it seems like its usually about 3 months till you actually feel comfortable again after coming off suboxone. That feels about right to me considering I feel about halfway back to normal at 40 days. I can surely say I feel so much better then I did at the start. It’s slow but it does get better. And everyday is another battle won. All the stories Ive read on here have given me hope to push through. It’s hard, but don’t let that stop you. I’m not special.

"30 Days Subutex Free Update. Even writing the title to this post blows my mind! Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I'd be announcing to everyone here that I've now been Subutex free for 30 days, but somehow, I've managed to see little improvements each and everyday since making the jump.

As for the physical withdrawals, the first 14 days weren't anywhere near as bad as I thought they were going to be. That being said, I jumped at as low a dose as possible (0.100mg) and followed this great [GUIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/suboxone/comments/ornhf3/easiest_way_to_get_off_bupe_without_getting/) by u/Gad_Music so I was well prepared in advance.

Overall, the hardest part for me was the mental rollercoaster of good and bad days. Days 15 to 21 were where I really struggled to lift my head off of the pillow and face the world. The mental fatigue was awful, especially for someone like myself who always feels guilty laying around the house doing nothing with my day.

With all that being said though, my energy levels are improving, the mental fog seems to have been lifted and my overall mood is slowly improving day by day.

Before the jump, I was on 16mg (8mg x 2) each day for a total of five years. It's been a LONG time coming, but I'm determined to keep fighting the fight. This subreddit has been a huge credit so I just want to take the time to thank you all!

"On 2mg subs for 3 years now, can I have a glass of wine?. Hi guys, I’m kind of new to this sub but I’ve been following it for awhile and I always got too anxious to ask anything but I see the advice y’all give eachother and I figured I’d give it a shot.

I used to be on blues and heroin for years before I got clean and put on suboxone. My cravings to do hard drugs is completely gone and I have no desire to even do them again.

"Stopping Before It’s Too Late. (Or Maybe It Is Too Late) Worried!. So I consulted with a Dr. exactly 7 days ago today about using subs to detox off oxy 60mg daily. I was given little to no information on dosage and was sent off with 21 doses of sublingual film 8mg/2mg for the first week and to reassess at our follow up in a couple days. I am down to 12 films and usually take 1/4 Pieces at a time. I have been taking a full film daily overall.

After reading the withdrawal struggles within this subreddit I now understand the severity of this medication. Half life extremely high. Less is more. etc. 

I have used subs in the past but only for a couple days. I had no withdrawals and consumed three 8/2 films in a two day period. Am I in too deep to stop while im ahead? Should I expect withdrawls? Should I taper with the remaining films? I do not want to be dependent on this medication as the with-drawls seem intense and horrendous. 

It sucks cause I thought this would be the breakthrough. But I can see why people would not want to be on this after a while and how long term users have to fight the wd’s and go through a long taper period. Which I do not want to go through hopefully.",0,0,0,1,1,0

"How Suboxone Films Absorb. My friend and I were talking about how the films absorb into the capillaries of your mouth. With the tablets it seems pretty obvious that they dissolve under your tongue and mix in with your saliva. The strips seem like they might be a little different because the package says you can take them buccally (on your cheek) but it doesn't seem like it would dissolve and mix in with your saliva from there. My friend also said you can dissolve the strips into water and put it under your tongue, but that's never worked for me. So do you think that the films get into your system by making direct contact with your skin, or do they mix in with your saliva and then get absorbed? He also said that when you take a film buccally more naloxone gets absorbed into your system. Just kind of curious to what everybody thinks.",0,1,0,0,0,0

"Anyone else get extremely Drowsy when driving every time on Suboxone/Zubsolv (Same as Suboxone just lower doses available.. So I am on Zubsolv which is 2.7 mg of  buprenorphine and .71 of naloxone and I have been on this dose for over 3+ years. I switched from Suboxone onto Zubsolv because I was weening off but started to feel really crappy on the lower dose of 1.4mg so I’m back on 2.7mg. when I started on 8mg of Suboxone for “off label” use that my Psychiatrist prescribed for me because of my depression and he thought I might have some kind of opioid deficiency disorder? Not sure what he was thinking but on the 8 mg  to start, I got pretty high honestly. Since, I hadn’t been taking any painkillers so he immediately reduced it to 4 mg and I was slowly reduced  down at one point to 1.4mg and was switched to Zubsolv.  Since they make a sublingual tablet that is less strong than Suboxone. I felt pretty crappy so I went back up to the 2.7 mg of this and I have been on this dose for over a year and I noticed that every time I  drive (especially right after taking my dose)  immediately after say 30 minutes even. I get extremely drowsy only when I’m driving.  It’s gotten to the point where my eyes are closing and I have to fight to stay awake. I feel like I could fall asleep at any moment while driving if I don’t concentrate. It’s the worst in the morning. I was very curious if anyone else had a similar situation and if they found anything that helps. I was also wondering if drinking coffee somehow has the reverse effect and makes you tired on this since I try and drink coffee when I’m driving to stay awake yet the coffee Doesn’t seem to help, so I stopped. It’s really a shame that he put me on this medicine when I wasn’t addicted to painkillers and now I’m addicted to the stupid medicine that makes me feel drowsy but especially behind the wheel.

"Medications that alter bupe metabolism. Tegretol and Depakote?. I have bipolar, and for me there's two medications that consistently make it a lot harder for me to remain stable on Suboxone and Sublocade. They are Depakote and Tegretol.

Tegretol is common knowledge it seems among prescribing doctors who stay on top of medication interactions. It's a well known CYP3a4 inducer, meaning it speeds up the enzyme that breaks down Buprenorphine such that higher doses are required to get the same effect.

However, owing to my genetics, I also seem to have the same problem with Depakote, which is frustrating for me because it's actually a really effective mood stabiliser in my case with minimal side effects. Strangely Depakote isn't supposed to have the same problem, but I swear for me it does. If I'm on Depakote, I need to consistently take 300mg Sublocade injections or I start craving again. And if I can't take higher doses of Subuxone/Sublocade, no or minimal blockade is provided.

I remember when I was on Suboxone, if I was on Tegretol or Depakote, I could use within 24 hours of my dose and still get significant effect. They make staying clean a lot harder.

"Day 23 update - please read if you're wanting to get off. ~preface~

Abused oxy for 2.5 years, started with small amounts but towards the end of it was using 200-300 mg most days. Then got on subs for 4 months. Tapered from 8 mg to 0.5ish. I felt good starting subs, and the taper was easy enough for the first couple months. Then the last month, under 1mg, I found myself hating the negative side effects and was just ready to be sober. I read so so so much about the withdrawals and stuff that I was really scared to jump. But at the same time I was just always in a bad mood, no energy, sex drive, feelings. I couldn't take being on subs anymore. So I got my affairs in order, told my dr, took a week off work, went out of town so I wasn't tempted and just fucking jumped. 

the jump &amp; honeymoon phase~

The first few days following my jump, I constantly felt like it was right about hit me. That at any moment the real opiate wds were about to start. Body temp regulation was a bit off, mild RLS at night, insomnia - but nothing terrible at this point. After another few days of laziness I realized it wasn't going to fuck my shit up like I thought it would. In fact, I started feeling better!.  Got goosebumps from books, vibed to music, and cried from movies. Reached out to old friends I hadn't talked to in a while. My appetite came back with a vengeance. FOOD IS SO GOOD AGAIN. Suffer knowing the end is near and life will be soso much improved should help get through the tough parts. I ate like a beast. I can concentrate on things relatively easy. Sex is sex again.

~paws~

The mild withdrawals lasted about a week. Despite them I felt damn good having feelings and energy again even without getting much sleep. Then that chapter ended and a new one began. This one was different, I felt no physical withdrawals but the mental component was a struggle. Depression, lethargy, a bit anxiety - but still better than when I was on 0.5g subs. This was worst around day 10. However day by day, I began slowly building myself back up. Starting running, and noticed I felt much better after doing exercise. Kept eating healthy and taking care of my body. Kept staying busy with books and movies. Each day has been better and better. I'm now at day 23 and feel more like my old self than ever before. Still struggling a bit with sleep and energy but overall feel good and proud of myself for NOT being dependent on any god damn substance or medicine to feel okay for the first time in years. Totally worth it

To anyone fretting about jumping - 

I can't promise you that your experience will be like mine. Everyone is different, and that especially applies to sub metabolism. But please, please, please just trust yourself, your doctor's, and your loved ones that support you. Don't believe all the horror stories from reddit. It'll be over before you realize it.

"Tapering off Subs, Need some advice. God, I am not looking forward to working this retail shift. I'm 22, been on subs for around three months, know a good amount about it, and was confused when I was put on this, because my DOC was always more benzos. I did concurrently abuse both but I guess I never realized how much I had done opiates too.

ANYWAYS. I've only been on subs for around 3 months. I was prescribed a FUCKTON and i mean like 16mg a day. I only took 2 mg a day, once. I did not want to be suboxone period, so I did not take anymore than 2mg a day. I've worked myself down to .5mg the past four days. I can't seem to get past here. if I don't take it, I feel like shit, but it's quite possible that its my overactive brain, symbolic of my benzo use. I'll start yawning, getting really irritable, lethargic. Sometimes, even sniffles. It's just so hard to tell how much of ANY withdrawal is more mental or physical. Before my first seizure from benzos, I had no anxiety. I felt a little UP, but not anything crazy. Then before the second one, I WAS FLIPPING OUT because I KNEW what was coming.

I don't know, I'm sorry if this is rambly. Insurance is dumb and works against addiction I feel. You're broke and have no job, abusing drugs, here's free health insurance. OH GOOD, you got a job?

"Taking my first Suboxone dose without going in to precipitated withdrawals. Please help.. I want to start Suboxone again after a relapse. I’m afraid of the withdrawals and want to do it as comfortable as possible. I went to a detox in April and am going to get Suboxone from a website. Originally, in the detox I’m pretty sure they hit me with about 12mg of Suboxone and tapered me each day. They made me wait over 30 hours before taking it because my pills have fetanyl in them. Sadly I’m back on it and want to get off. 

I want to know if I can take about 12mg instantly after like 20 hours as opposed to either waiting nearly 48 hours (as recommended when fetanyl is in the system). This also goes against what I’ve been reading online which is take 2mg and if you start precipitated withdrawing then take another 2mg every 30min to an hour. Would taking 12mg instead of 2mg as my first dose prevent precipitated withdrawals? Or do I have to do a 2mg dose, sending myself into precipitated, and then take a large dose to stop the precipitated? How can I stop it if I do precipitate? 

Really appreciate any feedback. Please help me get off this crap so I can live a sober life again.",0,1,1,1,0,0
"Taper update. Sorry for long post to come. 

My taper is going better than expected. I was originally at 8mg, then dropped to 6mg every other day, then finally 6mg every day. There was definitely some negative side effects and symptoms but once I got down to 6mg daily for a few days I stabilized and actually felt great. So I decided this week to drop down to 4mg after only about a week or so off all 6mg days. The reason I did this was because things were going well, and I have family coming into town soon and don’t want to do a drop when they are here. I don’t have a strict plan for my taper, just going by how I feel and trying to be a bit aggressive. I think once I get down to a smaller dose I will go slower. 

But anyway, I was supposed to go to 4mg every other day for the first week. I ended up kinda of forgetting and took 4mg three days in a row. I was feeling alright so if figured what the hell ill just stay at 4mg every day. So far it’s been going pretty well. I have some restlessness fatigue and the normal sweatiness/goosebumps, etc but I’ve been able to sleep fine with my nightly trazadone. Sleeping was my main concern so as long as I’m sleeping I can deal. Just an update because over all this taper is going much better than expected.

"Some days I feel a strong ""buzz"" after taking my sub, and some days I barely notice any change at all. How do I get the most out of these strips?. I've been on subs since January. It was great at first but, naturally, I've built quite a tolerance. I'm on 12mg a day.

As I said in the title, there's a big discrepancy day to day when taking taking my strips. Some days I get a strong buzz, which I appreciate because I take my subs in the afternoon when I have to get kids on the bus, run errands, and so on. This also gives me a break from my chronic pain. But some days when I take my strip, I feel almost no change at all.

I know that if you eat or drink while dissolving a strip it will wash away. Or it may dissolve too quickly and be swallowed. I've found that letting the strip dissolve slowly on the inside of my cheek tends to be the best way, sometimes it dissolves too quickly under my tongue, but even my cheek can be inconsistent.

"Smaller dose feels like more?. So basically I’ve been on suboxone for 8 months now. I started taking pressed 30s two years ago and was on them for a year and then I got a high paying job and was able to afford real script oxys from an older friend. My tolerance eventually built up and I was taking 2-3 pills a day which costed around $60-$90 a day and I wasn’t even getting that high anymore. I decided to start suboxone to try and taper off and it would at least be much cheaper. My doctor told me 8mg would be a good starting dose. She even told me it was a small dose. This is when I learned the doctors don’t actually know much about the drug like most of us have lol. 

I begin taking 8mg everyday in the morning and it was legitimately giving me a nod and felt significantly better than 2-3 oxys. I then started to begin to feel side effects like being zombieish and decided I wanted to go to a smaller dose. I meet with my doctor once and month and told her this on the 5th month. She convinced me to think about it for another month and then we can talk about it. 

Fast forward to month 6th and when I show up to my appointment it’s a different doctor and he says my regular doctor is on vacation and I’ll have to wait until next month to come up with a taper plan. Fast forward to month 7 and I’m ready to discuss a taper plan and she finally started talking about it. She said I should drop from 8mg to 6mg and I will experience withdrawals for a week. Then when she’s writing the prescription she asks me if I am currently seeing a therapist. I told her no and she said she won’t start me on a taper until I do. This then led me to the 8th month where I currently am. I have my next appointment in 18 days. 

So she prescribed me 30 8mg pills and I just started to taper on my own because it seems like she has been purposely delaying the process. And this leads to my question. I’ve been on 6mg for the past 3 days and for some reason I’m feeling much more euphoric and better than my 8mg dose. The 8mg dose used to give me a small buzz in the morning for 30 minutes and then I feel like a zombie the rest of the day. Now I feel euphoric and energetic on smaller dose. Sorry for the long story but does anyone know why a smaller dose feels better when my doctor told me I’d have small withdrawal symptoms?

I dissolve 25mg of naltrexone in a 16 ounce bottle of water and drink about 1 ounce each night. When I do this, I “feel” the bupe the next day. It’s not super euphoric, but it relaxes me and puts me in a good mood. Maybe a little bit of euphoria. I get that some of you will say I’m abusing, but I don’t care what you think if you’re going to judge me.

I've been on subs for about two months now. I screwed up though. This morning I found four oxy 7.5s in a coat pocket and took them instead of my morning sub dose (I know, I'm mad at myself but the addict brain is still there).

"Hello folks. I’m prescribed a very low dose of subs to dissuade use, and it’s gone well until the last few days. Now I have a small situation and a few questions.. I’m on 1mg strips (half a 2mg strip), once per day to dissuade kratom, extract and tianeptine use. I realize that is insignificant compared to many people’s situations, but it was initially a higher dose to get past the tia withdrawals, and because I’m currently undergoing a whole series of ECT (Electro Convulsive Therapy) sessions for severe depression and it’s critical that I maintain consistency for the anesthesia to work correctly and predictably. 

I have 2 weeks before my next ECT session, and I’ve messed up the last 5 days and took doses of tianeptine that easily overpowered the suboxone on 3 of those days, and skipped the subs altogether the other 2 days. I’m now starting to experience withdrawals (much more than I expected to experience) and need to get back to my consistent baseline within the next couple weeks. 

My question is, is there anything wrong with taking a higher dose of suboxone for the next few days to get myself through these withdrawals so that I’m able to sleep and not miss work? Would that even work? Would you foresee a problem getting back down to my small 1mg dose after a couple days of higher doses?

I understand and appreciate that I made a bad choice, and that it also likely seems minor to many of you. I’m not sure the best way to get out of this pickle and also make it to work when it’s important that I do so while I can. I’m not sure of a better place to ask this and really appreciate any thoughts or advice. Thanks.",0,1,1,1,0,0

"New and VERY scared. Hello, am 60 yo with a lot of back, neck, and spinal issues, and have been taking Norco 7.5 3xday for about 7 years. Went for med refill today and my doc hit me up with trying Suboxone. I didn't contend with him too much because tbh, Norco's no longer help as much with the pain, and just seem to be a major problem keeping them on hand anyways. Tired of feeling like I ""need"" them just to get going in the mornings. 
But, I also know that I have been taking the Norco's long enough that to come off of them is going to make me feel sick for quite a while. He says the Suboxone will help with my pain much better, because I won't have that hangoverish feeling if I ""don't"" take them. 

But I am very worried about what kind of pain levels I will be left with and very worried about withdrawing from the Norco's. 

I am reading that you have to wait 72 hours or some such before starting the Suboxone, but he said I could start at 13 hours if I only take a half one at the beginning. 

Anyways, any info or help to alleviate my fears and anxiety would be very appreciated. Do y'all think I will have a hard time switching over? And will Suboxone really help with my actual pains?

"Made it to Double Digits. Good Morning All,

Well not only have I made it to Day 10, but got through yesterday without grabbing my automated refill order after receiving the text saying it's ready for pickup. All the superficial withdrawal symptoms like the sweats, aches, watery eyes and nose and stomach issues have all but subsided since two days ago. I am still experiencing the whole bipolar body temperature regulation issue and sleeping solidly. But, the one thing that has returned is that I feel naturally sharper. I'm not taking any of this for granted because I have read so many testimonials and even journals online that have said even after months that your serotonin and general happiness doesn't return which is fully understandable. I'm beyond proud because this is one of the longest times I've ever gone, but in closing I am not going to get complacent one bit. Just wanted to post this showing that it is possible to jump off of a dose 2mg a day or higher. Now I'm just hoping that sleep becomes more solid as the days continue to go on because ATM the longest I have stayed asleep at a time for is 3-4hrs. Then I'm usually up for a few hours then maybe can get another couple of hours after that. I have Trazodone that was prescribed to me about a year ago, but the only substance I wanted to use during this jump was Advil for the head and body aches.

"Will taking kratom then a Suboxone put me in rapid withdrawal?. So right now I am addicted to heroin, I can't make the jump to suboxone before 2 days I go into  precipitated withdrawal.

The last time I took a Suboxone I was 35 hours in off dope was throwing up, shitting non stop, my bones and joints were in agony, cold but soaked in sweat, the whole 9 yards for over a day of dealing with all that. So I figured it can't get any worse than this and took a sub and it did GET worse. I wanted to jump in front of a car just to go to the hospital and possibly get pain meds it was that bad.

"Tips and or help with getting off Subutex. So first I will start by saying, I am in full support of Bupe, it saves life, anything to do to get off the dope is great, therefore I think subs are great for that. 

However, I have been on subs for about 8 year, and it worked great in the beggining, and it still works good,, but recently I have been wanting to get off of it. 8 years is along time, and idk where to even start. I

Like I said I think Bupe is great for it's purpose, but latley I have been wanting to get off it for many reasons. The main being is what is doing to my teeth (And i'm only 28) along with other possible health reasons, and i'm sick of being a slave to my doctor and the pharmacy. Plus I just feel like it's time, and this is the first time I have personally ever wanted to get off, so in my heart I want to, but the physical dependency has made me procrastinate attempting to get off subs. And every time I google it looking to get off of it, all I see is horror stories, and that also has held me back.

I will add I also take Klonopin, however that is mainly because I have a small case of epilepsy (very small case), just figured i'd add that as a side note.

So in conclusion, I don't want to turn 30 and still be on subs (Not that that is bad, I just personally feel like it's time to get off). And if I get off of it and need to get back on it, I can at least say I gave myself a chance and tried to quit.

If this helps, I would also like to add that I am perscribed 60 8 mg tabs a month, but only take 1 to 1 and a half every day now. So if anyone has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated. I really want to hear a success story of people getting off of them, because it seems I only read unsuccesful stories on the internet. And i'm aware it's not gona be a walk in the park, and will probally suck for awhile.

I will also add 1 more thing, I live in Texas and got caught with some THC gummy bears about 2 months ago, so I may be looking at jail time because edibles are poss CS PG, and my charge was Poss CS PG 2 between 4 and 400 Grams, which is a second degree felony in Texas. I had  1 personal baggie with 8 gummy worms and they weighed obver 4 G's total. My lawyer had told me he doesn't think I will do anymore actual jail time, but I will still serve my time, just outside of jail from what he said. Only reason I bring that up is because if do have to do some time, I do not want to go through that in jail if I have to go.

Its hard to hold my pee and 30 mins after i drink something i have an urge to go, like the pioe is going to burst any second. But my poops most of the time are normal. No blood in my stool. No vomiting. I know you guys aren't doctors but just wondering if anybody had something like i do. Before suboxone I was perfectly 110% healthy. Never had surgery for anything, never had stomach problems. Never even had a broken bone in my life. I hate to say this but I 200% regret going on suboxone from all the horrible side effects. The side effects were way worse above 2mg but I still feel like a geriatric patient. Thanks",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Did anyone else get addicted to suboxone by itself and not other opiods?. 8 years ago, I tried 2mg of suboxone just for fun. I trusted a friend of mine who said it was like opana, oxy, etc. which I had used a little here and there. I didn't have any dependence, I would just use them whenever they were around. Well, it only took that first time trying suboxone and I loved the feeling so I just kept using it. A few months later, I realized I had become addicted to it. I got them from a friend who was overprescribed. When I lost touch with him, I went to a doctor and here I am all these years later still on it. I'm on a taper plan and hope to be off by Spring.

"What works?. So a family member and I had a debate on sobriety and what ""works"" or is most successful for long term sobriety. For me personally rehab, detox, 12 steps, cold turkey, prayers, threats, breakups, and employment issues never seemed to work for more than a week. Suboxone and moving away 1000 miles is what worked for me. I include moving away because I really feel removing myself from the accessibility of Dilaudins (my DOC) and not having connects allowed me to continue Suboxone.  Also for me it wasn't the physical urge I struggled with but the mental urge of knowing without a doubt that if drugs were in front of me, I 100% could say no.  But that took YEARS.  Well over three years and probably closer to 5, to actually have the thought process ""I don't want to use""! 

 Anyways the debate is that rehab,12 steps, rock bottom etc is equally successful and I disagree.  I also feel the term rock bottom is overused because I know plenty of people, myself included that allowed their life to be 100% focused around addiction and still used...I figured I'd bring it to Reddit.

"Anyone have experience with using Alcohol Medications?. I’ve been on Suboxone since April, prescribed 16mg daily but I take 4mg daily since if I ever decide to stop I don’t want to taper down from such a high dose.

I know there are subreddits specific to alcohol medication but I was wondering if anyone here has used them in conjunction with suboxone, or alternatively how have y’all managed to combat other addictions or behaviors that have surfaced after the opiate problem has been relieved?  

I’m not sure if the heroin gave me motivation or happiness, but I do know that since stopping I have also lost joy in things I used to find pleasurable and don’t have a the same drive to succeed in my career anymore, and also am wondering if it’s the lack of heroin or if suboxone has caused this feeling.

"It's always now. I realize this isn't directly related to Suboxone in a traditional sense, but it totally is.  I personally am a fan of Sam Harris, I know many people can't stand him,[but listen to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSIAMaAYYj0) and just let your mind absorb a little of it.  I think nothing characterizes how we got here in the first place more than this.  The TLDR is that we get wrapped up in our lives, always reflecting on the past or anticipating the future and lose track of now.  He says ""The problem is that too many people realize they spent their limited time chasing the wrong things.""  That's why addiction is so evil. B/c you spend your time focused on the wrong thing - and little by little it moves up on the list of things that are important in your life and for most people, it gets there quickly.  It crowds out everything else.  


The reason sub is such an important drug is that it gives you a chance to care about what's most important (b/c it's safe) and b/c it lets you immediately quit focusing  on getting more.  If taken properly it literally forces opiates down lower and lower to the things you spend your time thinking about, caring about.    


We've seen a few posts lately about the whole issue about ""Are you clean on Subs"" and I vocally say ""Yes"".  B/c you're not putting yourself at risk of harm.  B/c you're not focused on getting anything else. B/c you're able to immediately snap out of it and start caring about all the other little things that became a casualty of the addiction.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Anyone thought of starting a ""suboxone sober"" subreddit since a lot of posts on here are about getting off of suboxone and how horrible it is?. I feel like people will take this post the wrong way but please dont. I genuinely feel as though there is such a large portion of this sub reddit that post negatively about there experience either while on subs or there experience getting off subs that maybe there should be a community solely aimed at supporting people who have decided to continue there sobriety without the use of suboxone. A place people can share how long theyve been clean from subs or how there taper is going. 

Its no secret that there is 2 groups of people here and i guess many more that branch off but the main 2 IMO are those that found suboxone and love it who dont think about when theyll stop and share about the benefits theyve gained by being on subs. as well as those who proudly say theyll never stop and take high doses wether there share that openly or not. Then theres those who talk about how horrible suboxone has been for them, how horrible there Dr. were for prescribing high doses and alot of them share how long theyve been clean from suboxone witch is awesome for them im glad.

Im honestly curious why there wouldnt be a seperate subreddit for ex sub users who dont plan on using them again and or people wanting to get off subs and want support in doing so? Im in no way saying either group is better and deserves to be here more than the other please dont think that at all. just thinking from a recovery stand point peer support is a huge key to recovery wether your staying clean from prescribed suboxone or heroin when your in a group of like minded individuals going through the same thing it can only benefit you.

Im relatively new to subs. 3-4 months now. suboxone saved my life and has helped me get off more than opiates. this is the longest most stable sobriety ive had in my entire life. ive posted before that i specifically do not share my dosage  anymore due to criticism and judgements the few times i have mentioned it. and not just a comment or 2 but ALOT of them and harsh ones, to the point of deleting my posts or comments. Ive had people try telling me my Dr. doesnt know whats right for me and im better off trusting people in this sub reddit... And lastly idk if ill be on it for life but i dont at all entertain the idea of stopping. when or if that time comes ill deal with it then. and theres people who dont need to be part of the conversation but only comment to tell you why you should have your taper plan and date ready.

I dont mean to come off as rude, but newly sober and new to suboxone its confusing and i guess scary to see people rejoicing at being suboxone free, and the worst one is people telling newbys (me)that ""the magic wears off"". if i came here and really spent time reading through posts i may not have went through with my induction. I guess this post is more of a conversational one. am i the only one that feels like its weird to have people sharing there sobriety from suboxone dates and horror stories of withdrawals on the same page as brand new patients sober for the first time may just be looking for guidance and reassurance?

"Suboxone migraines started after 3 years. Hi guys ive been prescribed suboxone after being on heroin. I take 4 mg in the morning 4 mg at noon and 4mg before dinner. Everything went very well the past 3 years no side effects at all besides low testosterone and a bit of weight gain, which testosterone helped greatly. The thing is the past three weeks ive been getting a headache right before i take my first dose which escalates to a very bad migraine around 4-5 oclock. I take rizatriptan 10 mg which knocks the migraine off but it sometimes comes back during the night. I tried to figure out what it was, hydration, nutrition, cologne,  stress . I tried to change every single habit to pinpoint the cause, to the point of changing my deodorant!!!🫣 i am convinced its the subs, can i switch to methadone or other opiate replacement, cause i sur cant go back to where i was in the past.

Potential Adverse Reaction to Generic Suboxone. This is my first time posting on this thread (and honestly Reddit in general) so please bare with me. I’ve been on suboxone on and off the past two years but didn’t really take getting sober completely until the beginning of this year. I started at 8mg of the generic pill and started tapering down last 2 months. Around that time I started getting some really bad symptoms like a persistent low grade fever and bouts of feeling faint which really scared me because a few times I thought I might pass out at work. I didn’t immediately attribute it to the taper because as I mention I’d been on subs before and never had a problem. I went and saw a doctor and got bloodwork done and everything seemed okay. The faint feeling has subsided but now I get headaches almost everyday and have lost a lot of motivation almost in a state of depression constantly. I’m currently down to 5-6mg a day but people I talk to say that it’s less to do with the taper and more that I’m having an adverse reaction to the generic subs. I’m having a hard time believing that because I took them for the first 4-5 months with no issue but now it’s become a daily struggle. I’m meeting with sun doctor next week to get back on strips to see if that helps but wanted to see if anyone had a similar experience. Thanks,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Tapering. I am working on getting the Sublocade shot. I've been on Suboxone for a little over 5 years. I've gone from 16 down to 8mg per day. I am going to try to taper to 4 or (hopefully) 2mg before the shot. My doctor is working on being able to receive, store, and administer Sublocade, so that could take a couple of months. I fucking hate being on Suboxone. It seemed like such a relief compared to active addiction, but now it just sucks. 

To the people that have successfully tapered, what helps? Supplements? OTC drugs? I've heard people mention comfort medications? I definitely do not want to switch addictions and I easily will, so I am not interested in Xanax or Valium (Is Valium even a thing anymore?)

"Precipitated and kratom. Just curious I’ve been taking kratom daily for almost two weeks, long story but I was taking a lot of grams despite that it’s barely made me high, not coming off opiates I was using it to come off alcohol which actually worked. I think I get minor withdrawals, I can go 18 hours and just feel a bit antsy but nothing crazy. Does anyone know how likely it is to cause precipitated withdrawals if I take suboxone early? Should I just wait as long as I can 18-24 hours or whatever or does it not matter you think? I believe the half life is about 3 hours so that should mean after 18 hours I have basically none in my system still. I have no clue why the kratom hasn’t made me high like usual I think some old sublocade (last shot 8ish months ago) must be still partially blocking it despite me peeing clean.

Now I don’t have to go but yeah I get anxious even taking benzos anymore. Even when I go to the ER and they give me Ativan or Valium it makes me worried.

What do you guys think? I’m looking for piece of mind but also honesty.

"Anyone else get gut inflammation/slow digestion when tapering to low dose?. I’ve recently tapered from 4mg down to 1.5 mg pretty quickly in a matter of days and have noticed my gut has felt off along with digestion not working as well. Is there an adjustment period when tapering? I thought the lower the dose the less side effects but my system seems to be less efficient on lower dose compared to when I was on 4mg .

"Suboxone and Coronavirus. Do you think If when it gets bad I don’t leave the house to go to my suboxone meetings I will get kicked out given the circumstances?

"Going on 6 years, and actively wheening from the program.. I searched endlessly for a sub to which I could speak. I am wheening from the medication. To start the new chapter of my sobriety.  I do not drink or partake in any mind altering substances to maintain my sobriety other then my bup. Meds. I am a 27 year old mom. And I've had a hard time finding an outlet to share and converse with others. I live in a rural small town, plagued with the ""all addicts are the devil"" mentality. Coupled with "" Its not my fault, I can't change cus its beyond my control"" crutch. And I just need a place where I can talk with ppl that understand my fight, and where I'm coming from. See I believe we all started our addiction one way or another, whether from medical issues, partying lifestyle that went out of control, or self medicating our mental or physical pains. This is what I label the beginning. Sometimes we are not in control of our beginnings, but what we are in control with is the middle, and our end. And I refuse to believe we have no control over the middles and ends, and don't accept excuses, or blaming others for the outcomes of such. I believe we only get better when we take ownership of our relapses, falls, and failures, rather then blame others for them. We all make choices, regardless of outside influence. And even when we lose control to an outside force, we are held accountable to regain control. Like many, inpatience rehab would prove useless to me. I needed to recover while continuing life day by day to retrain my brain, and lifestyle. I chose to take the medication assistance and have on track almost 6 years now, and for the past year, I have been wheening from medication. I have faced hate, and battled the stigma. Mistreated by others, doctors, and pharmacies. Treated like a monster most times. I discovered I was pregnant alittle over 2 years ago and worked closely with 3 specialists to keep this unexpected but automatically wanted baby healthy and safe. Yet faced stigmas and unbelievable obstacles by the Healthcare workers. And I feel often isolated. My son healthy and happy has aided in my recovery, but I often search for an outlet to speak on my experience with others. And if this isn't the one, can I have a few tips to point me in the right  direction. Thank you all, and safe travels threw this life, stay strong, and fight this fight day by day. You habe have strength, and the drive. Just because you took the wrong path before, does not define the path your creating now my friends. And I hold respect and pride for each and every one of you fighting threw addiction, and will be proud to meet ya on the solber side! Much love yall.",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Switched from subutex to suboxone. Feel like im always in minor withdrawal now. Do i need to dose up?. Ive been on MAT for like 7 years. Was on generic subutex cuz thats what my insurance covered best. Lost job with insurance. Could barely afford my script. Found out the place i go for counselling has a program where they pay for it but you gotta use their doctor. Qualified. Got in.

First appointment with their doctor, she is NOT having me be on subutex. Im like thats fine it was a money issue before but now it's not so put me on regular subs thats fine. Only request i had was i needed the tablets not the strips cuz the strips give me gnarly kanker sores.

So i went 16mg subutex a day to 16mg suboxone a day. For 2 weeks. This has been the hardest 2 weeks ive had in years. These dont seem to last as long, or work as good. Im super lethargic. Going to work takes everything i have. Soooo fucking tired at night but my minds wired and im restless. Ive had to call in 3 times already cuz i cant handle the labor and the hours in the state im in.

"Anyone use Suboxone for only pain?. Before my Kratom habit I injured my knee and ankle really bad, along with a fibromyalgia diagnosis a few months before that. It was a work accident and the l and I was refused any proper treatment... I had to sneak around and use my blue Cross insurance for a private orthopedic clinic. I didn't break anything but the sprains and strains had me on crutches for almost a year. I never got to a point of being able to walk very far and this summer was put on crutches again after tripping during a mild hike. 

Enter Kratom. My life is pain free for 2 years. 

Now I'm on Suboxone and my leg hurts worse than ever and today I had severe fibromyalgia symptoms (my fingers were in a lot of pain). I took more than usual yesterday and today and the pain is much more tolerable. I usually split an 8mg strip in halves for 2 doses a day. A half at peak pain helps a lot. 

Anyone using Suboxone for JUST pain? What's your dose? Do you start building a tolerance with it? And do you do anything else for the pain?

"And all I had to do was hold off on my dose. Hallelujah!. Constipation. Even over a decade of opioid abuse, I hadn't experienced it on any level remotely like that with subs.

I used to snort oxys, smoke and bang H, smoke and snort fent... All of it. I always had IBS with diarrhea, the drugs just made me normal. It was great. No painful flare ups, no agonizing shits multiple times a day... Then came getting clean, and bupe.

I often go around a week without a BM. It starts to suck hard after day 3 or so. Cranky, lethargic, bloated, the whole nine. Serious constipation makes you feel terrible 😥
No meds worked right. All variations and types of laxatives, nada.

My new plan, now that I've figured it out, is just hold off on my first dose of the day no matter what, until I can go.. Because god damn y'all, I easily just let go of multiple pounds of waste, not to mention blocked up gas. My stomach is flat again. I feel human!!!

"Suboxone taper/WD help. I’ve been taking sub on & off for what feels like 20yrs, between which I had cancer twice so I had to come off for pain management but went right back on it as soon as chemo concluded. My addiction doc pushed me up from 8mg/day to 16/day after my last treatment due to higher doses of pain meds. I didn’t complain and ended up stashing a ton of sub over the past year since I didn’t always need 16/day to function. 

Anyways, I had planned to taper even spoke with doc about it but before we could begin he passed away.

"Successful jump and my experience. Hi all, I wanted to come back to this sub, a sub that helped me tremendously with my taper and jump experience. I wanted to come back to tell you all that with a slow taper anyone can jump from buprenorphine and not have cravings for more opiates.

2 things though, you need to not be in the lifestyle of drug abuse anymore and you need to want it and know that being clean is better than being a slave.

I jumped at 0.4mg after a long taper. I did take a couple of smaller amounts over the next 3 days or so then had enough.

The worst thing was the insomnia and restless legs, but after 2 weeks (sounds like ages but in reality it isn't) it was all gone.

I have my life back, my libido, my ability to enjoy music and laughter, my clear head. Not feeling tired even without sleep. Not falling asleep in the evening.

I could not recommend a good taper and jump enough. It is tough, but essentially just feeling ill. After a few days all is good and you feel alive.

Got in methadone clinic at age 18. Stayed on that till 21 or 22. Got locked up for 8 years for distribution Released from prison 3-22-2019. The day I walked out I went straight to get on suboxone. It’s now been 3 years. I’ve grabbed a wonderful job. Bought my first house. Found the girl of my dreams. Life is great. Honestly I can’t ever see myself off of OUD meds they have helped me out tremendously along with my girl, beside every successful man their is a great woman behind him. I hate when people think differently about medications. People don’t look at depressed people crazy when they take Zoloft? Or their high blood pressure meds, by the way most people have high blood pressure because they can’t make the right choices in their life, same as us. It just pisses me off….",0,0,0,0,0,1

"Messed up and now will have to pay for it. So basically I am on holiday in a foreign hot country and have ran out of my Subutex and won't get any anymore till I get home.

I don't fly back till tomorrow and then I have to wait till Monday morning to get my script. I am on 4 mg. The flight is going to be a nightmare.

Don't know why but thought it would be a great idea to take an extra 2mg here and then and now I am out. Already been up since 4am dry wretching yawning, sneezing and goosebumps. Will probably get worse too. Just looking at my wife and kids asleep now and realised I probably just ruined their last day here. What a jerk I am.

"Bupe pills okay for chronic pain?. For some backstory: I’m a chronic pain patient. I had back surgery 3 months ago and had crazy back pain before. I do better with buprenorphine pain wise I tried belbuca in the past but it was too weak and could only be taken twice a day plus it’s ungodly expensive. 

So I decided to see a pain management physician who’s an anesthesiologist and also an addiction doctor. I do this because my current pain doc bless his heart is great but I have a lot of issues: he can’t prescribe suboxone or at least doesn’t wanna get in trouble, drug tests almost every month that cost around $250 each which is excessive for how model of a patient I am, and the 40 minute drive which is brutal in pain. 

It’s about $70 for bupe pills vs like $250 for suboxone genetic too for a months supply. Bad insurance and all that. Name brand suboxone isn’t even coveted under my plan and I see no need to cash pay for it I have too many medical expenses due to my chronic pain. 

So the logical choice is the buprenorphine pills aka subutex. I wonder is it as well absorbed under the tongue as subs? Can they be cut into 4ths and have an equal portion in each (I want to start very low and keep the dose to a point where I’m sober but in a lot less pain, not too energetic or naucus). 

TLDR: bupe pills (subutex) can I cut in 4ths? Is it as strong as suboxone? Suboxone vs bupe pills worth paying 3-4 times as much for generic suboxone? Why does every one sat generic suboxone sucks isn’t it the same amount of buprenorphine in it?",1,1,0,0,0,0

"Question about the process of Suboxone Tolerance. Hey all, sorry for the throwaway account, but I can't afford to have Suboxone questions searchable under my main right now.

Anyway, my question is about other people's experience with Suboxone tolerance. Over the last year, my doctor has been increasing my dose. I started the year at 2mg and now I'm at 16mg. I was never using a very high dose of opioid when I wasn't on Suboxone, so my tolerance wasn't that high, but my experience with Suboxone has been that—just like any other opioid—over time I build a tolerance and start experience withdrawal symptoms at any given does. If I understand tolerance correctly, my brain just adds more opiate receptors, so any dose I take it just.. adapts. I'm currently at 16mg, and I've started feeling mild withdrawals (on the COWS scale) in the afternoon before my second dose, and in the evening a few hours after the second dose. Is this in my head, or am I getting a tolerance? Is there a ceiling to this process, or do you just increase your dose forever?

"My doctor is an asshole. Hi, I've been on Suboxone for three years. In those three years I've never had a dirty drug test( except for cannabis that's legal in my state) and I've never missed an appointment.  I go once every thirty days. A week ago, I missed my appointment ( I'm doing my bachelor's, am a mom and nurse, plus I'm human!!) I promptly called the clinic left a message and then sent another through the healthcare app. I heard nothing for three days. 

On day four I get a message through the app from a nurse who tells me to reschedule my appointment through the app. Guess what? no appointments for one month. So, I messaged her back and asked what I was supposed to do without my medication. No answer so I wait another day and contact an MD through the chat. They tell me I need to go to urgent care to help with the withdrawals because they can't prescribe a medication that I've been on for three years.

Bernese method. I hit the point where I'm done I want my life back and money lol where I live it's 15-30 a pill do the math doing 2-3 a day you will be broke real quick.  I already started to taper down from last week from the 30s. I was doing 2-3 a day from last Friday to doing around a half a day today just using kratom and little lines of fent though out the day.  Kratom is a wonderful tool to help. It didn't feel good at times but Kratom can make it where you can get up drink coffee and tell people you have a cold and they wouldn't even think twice. I get around 7 hours before I have to do a line I just do the Littles line to just take the edge off I'm not trying to get high just make it where I don't feel like my bones are bruised. I started my Bernese this morning with .25 and a line and tonight I'll do it again and just do what it saids to do take a little sub everyday and less fent work your way up and take your fent down. I plan on taking kratom during the day and do a line after the sub if I need it.  Has anyone use Kratom in-between instead of the actual fent? And because I had already taper down will it help with the method a little bit better?  It's been 7 months since I've done a sub but I got really heavy after that. Oh for the people that are wondering after I did that . 25 of a peace I didn't get sick. Just please don't rush it or you will be sick.,0,0,0,1,1,0

Good thing is my surgeon was my brother's girlfriend dad who wrote off the surgery and send me to a pain management doctor. this doctor is the best thing that's ever happen to my situation. He understands how someone can be in pain and turn into a addict.not trying to get high.but just trying to get by with life. He gives me subs every month. Even when I relapse.

First I was on a small dosages.then 30 8mg a month. then 60. and today he said I'm loosing weight.ive told him about my dad's stage 4 lung cancer.

If I say I take it for pain they said that drug isn't used for pain. I can't take opiates . But this isn't used for pain.but to manage my pain and keep me off other drugs.

"Coming off Suboxone the right way. So I’ve been taking suboxone 8/2 mg strips since January and recently started my taper. I began to feel like the side effects:
-insane perspiration (sweating)
-low sex drive
-insomnia and trouble sleeping 
-afternoon crashes (like crashes on steroids)
-constipation 

As well as others weren’t worth it. So I went cold Turkey. I got to a full 72 hours and couldn’t take it anymore and took about a quarter of one. That got me going for a few days. I’ve settled on a maintenance dose of 1mg (1/8) every day. I’m getting my drive back and not sweating as much and am sleeping much better without needing an afternoon nap. Here are some things I’ve learned. 

-cold Turkey isn’t the way unless you’re totally without and have no choice. Don’t do it to yourselves 
-it’s about 2/3 as has as full opiate withdrawal 
-be patient. You’ve been taking this medication some of you for years. Don’t expect to come off in a month or less. 
-clonodine is a great alternative and excellent anti anxiety pill that will help you come off 
-expect your cravings for opiates to return and learn to fight them. If you can’t or don’t work any sort of program, I’d strongly recommend staying on the medication on at least a maintenance dose
-listen to your body. If you’re at 1mg a day and need a little more, there’s no shame in taking a little extra. 
-please, if you can’t abstain from opiates, keep taking suboxone and accept it’s necessary. It’s better to live on suboxone then to die with dope. 

Hope this is helpful. Would love to hear feedback and success stories.",0,0,1,0,1,0

I hate talking badly about suboxone but when you’re not meant to be on it, it sucks so much. Tapering slowly is not easy but to be successful it needs to happen.

Edit: here is my story about me getting on suboxone and what happened:

I have a very bad lower back. My old primary doctor put me on Vicoprofen 7.5mg for my pain. I had tons of scans done of my back and nothing ever showed up. My brother died on April 26, 2014. It was very traumatic. I now do have PTSD from it. He had schizophrenia. He abused drugs and alcohol. But he was suffering and every day was a waiting game did the day he’d end up dying. I had also been dumped 8 months prior to him dying by my first love after being together for 2 years and living together for 1. I actually went from 136lbs to 103lbs in 6 months after I was dumped because I just couldn’t eat. It was pretty bad. So being miserable, I took Vicoprofen than I should have. The max is take was 8 in a 15 hour period. But it was not all the time and it was not for a long time. Because addiction was in the family, I saw what I was doing. I told my primary and she had said she was giving me less because she saw me starting to do it too. She said to me, ""there's a medicine called suboxone. I don't know that much about it but it helps with withdrawal"". So me being afraid and aware of what was going on, I made an appointment with a psychiatrist I'd seen before and she threw me on 2mg of suboxone. I went in blindly. I had ZERO idea what suboxone was. 4 years later and now I'm finally down to 0.28mg. I am doing a very very slow taper. I got addicted to suboxone but I was not a full addict yet before being put on it.",0,0,1,0,1,0

"Tremors?. I stopped kratom on the 10th and started 4mg suboxone on the 13th. This week I went down to 2mg. I have felt slightly shaky each morning but it goes away when I take some xanax. I've also been having weird feelings like I don't recognize my life and am detached. Very hard to describe. Anyway, I got out of bed this morning and my whole body was in bad tremors. Never experienced anything like this. I took some xanax and they are getting a little better but I feel like I need to go to the ER. I've also been drinking like 3 drinks a night for most nights so maybe that is causing an interaction that is causing the tremors??

"Cutting down on time under tongue = tapering?. So I cracked and have been doing a bit of sub for the past 10 days, pretty much .5 first few days, .25 a few days after that and .125 for the past 4-5 days. 

For the past few days I've been leaving the .125 pieces under my tongue for shorter and shorter periods of time. 10 minutes one day, 7 the next, 3 today, etc.

Can this be considered a tapering method? I'd hoped so, but I feel a little too good today and now I'm wondering if I've been essentially doing the same dose for 3 days. I know it's not the most scientific method in the world in terms of being exact with what you're getting, but it seems like it would work - otherwise what would be the point of leaving it in for 15 minutes?

"DOT Certification. I am potentially going to be transferring to a different position at the company I work for & it will require a dot physical, does not require cdl. But with the physical’s they abide by the cdl laws. With that said, what has everyone that has dealt with this done? I had my dot cert before & the doctor I went to the first time was super cool about it & it was no a big deal. He congratulated me on recovery, approved me & wished me well. When I went to renew it 2 years later, they would not approve me because of the zubsolv I take. It was not a huge deal at the time, so I did not pursue it. Zubsolv is the only medication I am prescribed & take. I am gradually going down, right now at 1.5-2mg a day. I have been on it for quite a while & have a clean driving record(not that the doctor cares). I am sure without a doubt my Doctor would write me some sort of letter if needed.

"[7 Day Update #2] Holy shit, I'm jumping. Today is day 7! Definitely no going back now. 

I updated about days 1 and 2 already. 

Days 3-6 were possibly a little harder,  at times, but still totally bearable. I was able to work, go see fireworks, go to a wedding (and even dance!) and work on the house we're demo-ing/rebuilding. Keep in mind I was never someone who was willing to go do anything when I was dopesick. I was never a ""push through it, distract yourself, get your mind off it"" sick person. I was a lay in bed and moan and groan and focus on every symptom miserably type of sick person.   So I think that speaks to the fact that going out every day and doing life means the kick has not been bad at all.  I'd have moments of dragging ass and feeling heavy, some random bouts of sneezing which triggers chills/hot flashes/running nose/watery eyes but it would generally pass. At no point did I ever consider calling my doctor to get my last two subs back. 

I slept great the first two nights. The last few, I've had some squirming restlessness when trying to fall asleep, got some anxiety each time that I was about to be in for a bad night, but still have fallen asleep within 30 minutes and then slept through the night. 

Part of my motivation to get off subs is to find my baseline in order to pursue the cause of my brain fog, fatigue, sleep issues (never wake up feeling rested), depersonalization/derealization. These things I had before subs, before heroin, and they are still persisting now (i thought they seemed a bit better on day 1 and 2 but nah). But all that is just a crappiness I've just always felt (and now finally have a clean slate in order to try to find out why!)

Honestly, I'd been feeling generally shitty after going down to 0.125mg in April by cutting out and evening dose of .0625, right at the time my subs went generic (no idea if correlated or not). I attributed it to the fact that I got 3 vaccines at the same time and had a bad reaction, but I'm wondering if I was actually just in low level withdrawal that whole time because this week has not been much different from the last few months. 

I haven't used any pharmaceutical comfort drugs through the process, just the things I mentioned before (magnesium, high dose vitamin c powder, broad spectrum (no thc) CBD, strong passionflower tea, valerian root).  Its all working so I dont dare take anything out of the mix right now.

Today is day 7, and I basically feel normal. 

I'm feeling sooo hopeful and out of the weeds right now. If I can do it, so can you!!",0,0,1,0,1,0
"Give it to me straight, how bad of a plan is this?. So I got on subs after heroin addiction followed by a year of heavy heavy Kratom use.

I've been on subs for a year and a half now 12mg most of the time, spent a month or two at 8mg, then got to 4 over another month, now I'm at 3.

I know everyone says go super slow but I just can't spend another six months to a year tapering so I can finally start living my life again.

I have two months left of my klobopin prescription and then I'll be out, and I want to be off subs by then.

My plan is to go down to 2mg for about 10 days, then do 1.5mg for a week, 1mg for a week, .5mg for a week or 10 days, then jump from there.

When I jump I'll still have 60 klonopin to ease my symptoms. I might also take a  .25mg every couple days at first to ease it but this is my plan, I just want to be through this awful chapter of my life.

I'm going to take two months off of work and just feel like crap and take care of myself while I get this all out of my system. I have a good support network and am not in a position where I feel worried about relapsing, I don't even know where to get h here.

So how bad will it be?

Going from 3mg to zero over ~6 weeks?

"Anybody ever heard of Suboxone micro-induction for fentanyl addiction?. I ask because I am considering doing this and, if possible, I would like to hear from someone who has done it or knows a little bit about it and can maybe answer a question or two for me.

Basically, I would take a *very* small amount of suboxone but continue using fentanyl and slowly increase the dose until it totally blocks the opiates I'd start with about  0.125mg on the first day, 0.25mg on day two, 0.375mg on day 3, and so on until I can comfortably discontinue my fentanyl use. Apparently, patients are not sent into precipitated withdrawls from this because the doses are so low. -- In the studies I believe the patients were started at 0.5mg but I want to start as low as possible.

The reason for choosing this method over the usual method that one would normally use for heroin addiction, is because of the fact that fentanyl is absorbed into the body's fat cells in the same way that marijuana is. This causes it to remain in your system for a lot longer than traditional opiates normally would (usually 8-12 days from what I've read) so even if I were to take 8mg and *only* do so after waiting until fully in withdrawls, I would still go into precipitated withdrawls.

For those who have never heard of this method, it was used in a study done by Penn State as well as Rutgers. I will happily include links in the comments once I figure out whether or not links are allowed on this sub.

My job is such that I work long hours and not much time off so no time for being sick but it seems inevitable. I’m sure I’m not the only one who has had this thought but I’m at the point I want off the medicine. I can deal with my pain and am not worried about going back to pain killers. How much easier would detox from Suboxone would it be if they used the technology they have in the Butrans patch but made detox kits? Different starting points in patches with the perfect amount of the medicine lined out in one or two months. Just follow the directions on changing patches and not have to worry about cutting medicine up into tiny bits. Maybe it’s just me but I think it would be great for those of us ready to kick it. They could put the exact right amount of medication on each patch to detox people in a few months that would be completely painless! This will never happen because big Pharma wants us on the medicine, they don’t want us to stop. I’m ranting I know but thinking of the impending doom I’m about to face and the reality of not being able to find a Doctor that understands in my area has me extremely anxious and thinking about how easy the pharmaceutical industry could make detoxing from Bupe. So frustrating! I hope everyone is well in their sobriety and maintaining through this crazy pandemic and quarantine. My State hasn’t gone to full lockdown yet but even if they do, my job is on the essential services list (energy sector) so I won’t end up quarantined at home.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Day 4 no Suboxone no signs of detox am I in the clear?. Okay here's the deal I took Suboxone 4 mg twice a day equaling a total of 8 mg daily for about a month give or take a few days. My last dose was around 12 p.m. Sunday it's currently Thursday 5 - 7 - 20 at 6pm currently there has been no major signs of detox other than some tiredness and trouble focusing which is usually common with me in general. Am I in the clear as far as detox goes?? I feel like I may have dodged a bullet, now I have taken some Tianeptine (5-800mg daily) since quitting but I have taken that regularly on and off for several years. I'm not sure if that would make a big difference I wouldn't think it would personally.

"Buprenorphine (Espranor) UK Newbie advice. Hi. Ive recently started taking 12mg buprenorphine to treat my £20 per day heroin (smoked) habit. Ive read the wiki and loads of comments but Im still not completely sure of the answer to this so any takes would be much appreciated...

I take buprenorphine once per day in the form of Espranor, a fast dissolving (on the tongue) wafer type tablet and feel ok most of the time. I take it in the morning at the pharmacy and I still feel slight withdrawal first thing when I wake up. Also, I still really miss smoking heroin. 2 questions. 1) is smoking gear (heroin) on top of the bupe a total waste? even in the morning when i feel a bit sick and 2) will they be able to see from a urine test if ive been using heroin on top of the bupe? theyre both opiods right so wouldnt i test positive regardless?",0,0,1,1,0,0
"Bernese method for micro induction of buprenorphine/suboxone/subutex.. For starters I’d like to say I transitioned from methadone to buprenorphine and had no noticeable withdrawals. I was scared for months prior to changing these meds, primarily because I have put myself into precipitated withdrawals from using too much buprenorphine while on methadone, and it was not fun. 
But it is possible to start buprenorphine without having to wait for your current opioid to leave your system. 
I will outline how I went about changing from methadone to buprenorphine now.
I was on approximately 40-50mg methadone per day, for about a decade, I’d been on much higher doses also, and I do not believe dose amount matters for the Bernese method. 
The first day, I took my methadone dose as normal, and took approximately .25mg subutex. A quarter of a milligram is not enough to precipitate withdrawals, so if you start with small doses, you’ll be fine. Day 2, kept taking my methadone,(40mg) and took approximately .5mg buprenorphine and felt fine. Day 3, decreased methadone to 30 mg and took .75mg buprenorphine, felt fine.
Day 4 took 25 mg methadone and 1 mg buprenorphine and still felt fine.
Day 5 took 20 mg methadone and 1.5mg buprenorphine and felt fine.
Day 6 took 15 mg methadone and took 2mg suboxone.
Day 7 took 10 mg methadone and 3 mg buprenorphine.
Day 8 took zero methadone and took 4mg buprenorphine.
After the 8th day, the methadone had zero effects, I tried taking a 20mg dose and felt nothing.
This in short, is how you do the Bernese method.",0,1,0,0,0,0
"NYC Area Suboxone Program - Hybrid Telehealth/In-Person. First, I want to thank the moderation team for giving me permission to post about our agency as a resource. This is an extremely helpful way for us to engage with people online – so it is very appreciated.

My name is Brian, and I am a Community Outreach Liaison for Center for Community Alternatives, or CCA. CCA’s mission is to reduce reliance on incarceration and promote restorative justice in accordance with civil and human rights. 

You can read more about CCA here: [http://communityalternatives.org/](http://communityalternatives.org/) 

CCA’s Crossroads to Recovery program has been around for years, but now we are finally equipped to provide MAT for individuals with substance use disorders. Right now, our doctor is meeting with folks via telehealth and in-person to provide Suboxone.

While our main office is in Brooklyn – residents from all over NYC and the surrounding areas are eligible for our services. In fact, we have recently done intakes for individuals who live in Yonkers and Staten Island. Most of the programming can happen virtually through telehealth – or in-person if you prefer. Immigration status is not an issue, and we can work with folks who do not currently have insurance and help them obtain insurance. 

We are also fast-tracking participants; individuals referred to me can complete their intake ASAP and meet with the doctor within the next day or two.

If you are a NYC resident and live within the surround areas and are interested in this program, please reach out to me directly.

"36MG??? way too much?. someone I knew had been prescribed pain medication for a long time and kept slowly being forced to taper off by doctors. They went from being prescribed 150mg a day to 60mg a day of oxy. they have been taking about 90mg a day for maybe a year and decided to go get on suboxone on my suggestion and doctor recommendation. now, I get prescribed 16mg a day of suboxone and usually only take 8mg of that. 
this person has asked to be prescribed 24mg, and now wants to be bumped up to 36mg. have you been prescribed 36mg before?

"Workit Health telemedicine experience. So I had been using Bupe.me for the last few months since getting on sub from fent and yesterday I got a Facebook ad for Workit Health and I hadn’t heard of them so I looked into it. Here’s my experience..

I downloaded the app and filled in my information. Including my insurance info. It was really quick and easy. Once creating the account it immediately took me to choosing an appointment time for induction appointment. This was 3 pm yesterday and had appointments available for as early as 730 am the next day(today). I chose 830 am. I was never prompted to pay which I though was weird so I messaged the support thing and asked about if I would get script same day and about paying. Got an auto response that support would be open Monday morning at 8am. The app if very well designed. There’s a chat tab at the bottom and has 3 different chat logs already there to choose from for either Admin, counselor or provider. Literally at 8:02 am this morning I had a response. Very impressed by that. So onto the actual appointment..

My NP, Jessica, I was very impressed with. Could tell she was actually engaged and cared. Told me they work from the harm reduction approach. Took into account everything I brought up and was very intelligent. When we got on the subject of my dose I told her what I had been taking for the last few months and that it seemed to be holding me but I have a few days a week where I’d get intense cravings but that I really didn’t want to go up in dose because my ultimate goal is eventually complete abstinence. So what she said was I’m going to write you your normal 16mg a day with some extra strips. If you have a day where you need to take an extra half due to cravings you can do so. Otherwise let’s stick to 16mg. It’s the first time I’ve ever had a sub doctor think outside the box like that that wasn’t completely upping the dose without a second thought. I know it sounds so simple but it also impressed me. She literally sent the prescription over to my pharmacy while I was on the video call with her and I got the auto text from Walgreens that they had received while still on the chat with her. We talked for a good minute and I definitely enjoyed the experience. She told me “We are treating you with suboxone for opiate use disorder. If you smoke weed or do some other drug we are not going to cut you off for that. We don’t encourage it but if we can help get someone stable on the opiate part of things then that’s a potential life saved.” I don’t use any other drugs but I definitely agree with the harm reduction approach. 

I never was charged anything. My insurance covered the whole visit. Most insurance plans now have little or no copay for virtual outpatient mental health stuff. This service includes your own counselor/therapist that you can talk to any time. I asked her what the cash price is for people without insurance and it’s 300$ a month which isn’t the cheapest option. You get what you pay for though with how well everything is managed and how quick response time is. There’s no worrying if the script will be there or not because she sends it while on the video call with you every month. 

Sorry for the wall of text but I wanted to share my positive experience. Especially for people with insurance that hasn’t been able to utilize it since most other services don’t accept it.

"gabapentin and Suboxone safety.. Ok hopefully nobody judges but I've taken 2700mg gabapentin at 1pm today 1200mg at 6pm and another 1200 at 10pm.

(6mg which is the avg adult dose I'm just prescribed alot) and a beta blocker. I'm prescribed everything besides the gabapentin. 

Since I only take half of the antipsychotic and they think I take twice as much and I have a pretty high Suboxone and gabapentin tolerance do you guys think I'm safe to sleep right now at 2:30am? My breathing feels normal and I'm not insanely tired or anything just bored and don't wanna sleep the whole day tomorrow so I want to go to sleep right now if it's safe. 

Again I only took half my antipsychotic today and all days tbh and half my sub dose even. Just alot of gabapentin but spread out.

Does anyone know how long you should wait after taking about 24mg of suboxone before taking any type of opiate?

I've been told that you might have to wait up to three days in order for the pain meds to work and I don't know how I'll be able to cope for that long.

Also, if the buprenorphine does in fact sit on your opioid receptors for up to 3 days then why the hell do you ( or me atleast) still get withdrawal symptoms every day before I take my subs?
If I take the subs early then I'm usually feeling shitty by evening so on a  normal day I try to take it later on in the day but I almost always have withdrawal symptoms the following morning.

"PSA on dosage and mitigation of side effects. 1-4 mg is by far the best dosage range, less really is more. If you find yourself having any sort of side effects, and you’re above 8mg, you can easily titrate down to 4 painlessly. You can either stay at 4, where you’ll be at max saturation basically, but not feel the Ill effects of too much bupe, or you can venture down to 3 or 2, which will give you back more emotion. Trying to get below 2 becomes exceedingly difficult for most people for some reason, but it can be done. I believe  for some people, microdosing sub once you’ve been on maintenance for a while is the best option—you get a buzz while getting to keep hold of your sense of self, you feel much less “on” something.

"Zubsolv Trick!. Hi all! 

Just a little background:

I have been constantly on some form of buprenorphine for about 2 years now, but have been in recovery on and off since July of 2014. Currently, and really for the past 3.5 years, my life has been incredible (for the most part). I finished my Masters degree, have an amazing partner, go to AA meetings, have a career, and am (once again for the most part) an honest, contributing member of society.

Of course, though, I do not really talk about being on MAT in meetings due to the stigma (this is another issue for another post). But MAT and buprenorphine work for me, and I happily consider myself as being a person in long-term recovery.

Anyway, I digress.

I just wanted to share a quick trick that works wonders for me with my Zubsolv (which I switched to from Suboxone about 8 months ago). I take between 1 and 2 5.7/1.3mg zubsolv tablets per day, typically split in half and taken every 5 or 6 hours. Sometimes I need a little more, sometimes a little less. But I am prescribed the equivalent of 16 mgs of suboxone per day.

I noticed that tucking the tablet between my lower lip and gum results in a much steadier absorption for me, with less medicated-saliva being swallowed than the normal, under-the-tongue route. It usually takes about 45 minutes to completely dissolve, and I can generally eat, drink, and talk this way. I feel like more medication is absorbed, AND it is absorbed at a much steadier rate. 

Honestly, it makes every other method pale in comparison. I feel much more balanced, and it has made a wold of difference for me. 

Just wanted to share this experience in case some of you are having a tough time adapting to their medication. 

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, and this is my own experience and not medical advice. 

Another disclaimer: I shared this with my doctor, who was completely okay with this method and agreed that it could work better for some people. Buprenorphine can be absorbed both through the mucous membranes all throughout the mouth--so this makes sense.",0,1,0,0,0,0

"Just received a notice for a Class Action Lawsuit for Suboxone. Hey y'all. Many of us received a decent chunk of money back (though not nearly enough to make up for what we overpaid) the last time they had a suit. I'm not sure if those people can try again with this one, I didn't see anything saying no on the website, but maybe someone who knows that stuff can look it over. I just did a quick skim. 

Mainly I wanted to share for everyone who missed out last time. Anyone who paid for Suboxone between Jan 2012-Sept 2019 in certain states (CA, FL, IA, MI, MN, MS, NV, NY, PA, VA, WI) is eligible. The suit is against Indivior.

"what to expect going through PAWS. So I am 28 days off suboxone, I jumped at 1mg due to having to get off them earlier than I wanted to, that being said the first 10 days were not ideal I took the COWS and scored moderate in symptoms. After 2 weeks symptoms felt much better but lethargy and depression crept in, but my sleeping improved after two weeks i could sleep 6 hours I'd still wake every 2 hours or so but could go back to sleep my RLS was minimal as well. Almost at 30 and sleeping is better getting 7 to 9 now and waking less throughout the night no RLS anymore only symptoms that seem to have stayed is depression and lethargy.

1-1.75 mg daily taper schedule suggestions? Or should I go cold turkey? Plz any suggestions!. Hi I’m 30 F with a 1 yr old toddler been on subs for almost 2 years this time. I am trying my hardest to get off but apparently I’m a pussy. I am about to purchase all the supplements I need but still wonder the pace I should taper at. I’ve been going back up to 2mg or 1.75mg every 3rd day. Idk if that is helping or hindering me. I want to be off by June idk if that’s possible though. I’m also aware I should be doing this with my dr. But he suggested I get on subblocade for 6 months and said the only dose is what = 8mg after being on 2mg for a year I didn’t want to go back up that high. That seemed scary and counterproductive. But I’m already sick and tired of being sick & tired it’s been about 2 weeks. I dropped to 1.75 for a week and sorta jumped to 1 mg a for a few days lol.

"odsmt and subs. A friend asked me a very good question and thought I'd relay it here and see what answers we can find. They've been on odsmt for awhile now anywhere from 300-500mg per day, and have been thinking about switching to bupe films to get away from the nasty WDs that hit them within 8 to 12 hours of last odsmt dose.. knowing that buprenorphine has a wayyy longer half life could possibly stave off the withdrawals with daily doses. Their question was whether or not you needed to already be in WDs to start bupe or suboxone if you've only been taking odsmt since it's not your conventional opioid. In my head I know it still clings to MOR receptors and the bupe would probably rip the odsmt away causing nasty Precip. WDs if they did not wait and took it in the same 24 hours as odsmt. Is this a correct assumption? Or is it possible to take both same day with zero repercussions? Thanks for any tips or advice curious to see peoples opinions",0,1,1,1,0,0

"Having a baby on Suboxone.. First off, I'd like to preface this with if you do anything at all get off the Suboxone,or have them change your script don't let them give you more than you already have been taking which they will try and do. They will tell you all kinds of lies to make you think that it'll be okay and it isn't. FDA approved doesn't mean shit when you're at home waiting for your baby to be discharged a week later. 

I made the mistake of letting them convince me that the best thing for my baby and me was continuing my regiment. I wanted to quit the Suboxone or be given another type that wasn't as strong. They refused because they claim that the FDA states it's a safe drug and in their opinion changing anything would risk more than a possible withdrawal for the baby at birth. They also claim that they don't actually withdraw unless you're on an extremely high dose. That's also false. They do, it may not be methodone bad, but anything is bad enough.

The guilt that you feel, the way you are completely broken leaving the hospital without your child is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. The time that is stolen from you. I will never get those moments or days without my baby back. Someone else is holding them, feeding them, changing them. All because I wasn't a big enough advocate for myself, and especially my own child.

I told him I asked the pharmacist if they did and pharmacist looked it up and saw that the Naloxone part actually can cause heart issues for some and it’s the most common side effect.

So I just moved to a new state and filled my script and got Dr. Reddys (previous was Mylan for a long-time). Maybe I got a bad batch but holy shit these were terrible. Been on these Reddys for about 2 months and feeling crummy. I have an autoimmune disease and some other things going on so I didn’t suspect the Dr Reddys strips at first.

It finally dawned on me that maybe the strips were the problem, so I got a prescription for the brand name. Wow, what a difference!! On the brand name strips, I feel more clear-headed, less jaw clench, and the dose lasts much longer. My autoimmune flare up also stopped--it turns out that being in slight wd from the weak Dr Reddys strips caused my condition to flare up which can actually turn into a life threatening event as my breathing is affected!

"Has anyone completed an accelerated buprenorphine detox, from the Coleman Clinic or elsewhere?. I've posted a couple of other posts regarding my current problem. I'm metabolizing buprenorphine too quickly, I keep having to raise my dose. It stated happening after I attempted the accelerated detox from the Coleman clinic. In order to speed up the detox process, they give you micros doses of Naltrexone everyday, it puts you in precipitated withdrawal but supposedly pushes you through the withdrawal period more quickly. So instead of it taking three to four weeks to complete the acute withdrawal phase, it only takes 10 days. I was unable to complete the detox, it was too painful and I quit on day six (which I now regret). 

It's an expensive procedure, but I'm thinking of trying it again. I just want to know if anyone out there has completed it? If so, how was their experience? Was it successful? They told me eventually once the dose of naltrexone got high enough, the shots wouldn't cause as bad of a reaction (the precipitated withdrawals wouldn't be as bad), is that true?

"Is there a known way to convert buprenorphine mg/day to methadone mg/day?. I'm considering switching to methadone from buprenorphine 6mg/day. I was on 16mg for about a year and have tapered to 6mg over the last few months.

Is there a way to calculate how much methadone is equal to 6mg of buprenorphine a day? I've found a few sources but the result is not what I expected, so I want to check.

Considerations:

* Buprenorphine's efficacy is not linear.
* Buprenorphine has a ceiling effect. (At 6 mg/d I should be just near that)
* Methadone is a full agonist and has no ceiling so might provide more effective relief because of a wider range of action (?) and so less mg/d are required (?)

When I use equivalency tables meant for pain to calculate the equivalent dose, I end up at about 70 mg methadone/day. This was much more than I expected. I was hoping for something like 10-20mg, 30mg at most!

In another source, I read that buprenorphine's ceiling effect is equal to approx. 300 mg/day of morphine. And that a 2 mg/day bupernorphine is equal to 60-180 mg/day of morphine. That would still put me, using buprenorphine 6 mg/day at around 300 mg/day morphine equivalent and hence 60-120 mg/day of methadone. That confirms my initial findings.

**Is this accurate? Does anyone have experience with going from bupe to methadone? If so: how many mg/day were you on, for both?**",0,1,0,0,1,0

"Chronic pain. Has anyone been prescribed suboxone just for chronic pain. I tried belbuca which is similar just no naloxone bur at a much lower dose. I really like that theirs no high and it works better for pain. The problem is it’s nowhere near enough for my chronic pain. It’s also really expensive and takes forever to dissolve. Even after an hour quite a bit is left and I can’t eat or drink during so it’s kinda a pain. 

Question is how do I get it for pain. My pain management doctor said he can’t prescribe it for pain due to dea regulations. I thought they can prescribe it off label for pain without a dea waiver but I’m unsure and haven’t found a good source on it. I guess how do I find a doctor who is willing to and can prescribe it for pain? And will I be labeled an addict for doing so and denied pain medication in the future? Do I have to pretend to be addicted to opiates to get it? 

Also for those that take it for pain do you notice it kinda stops helping with the pain after only 6, hours while belbuca adversities 12 hour pain relief?

Btw I’m currently taking 150 micrograms twice a day but it absorbs better so this is about .285mg of suboxone twice a day. Also since this isn’t helping for pain I’m taking about 10-15mg of hydrocodone in-between dosages to kinda help make it stronger and prolong the pain relief.",1,1,0,0,0,0
"Bupe shot?. Aight flat out, I don’t think I have the self control to make it to say month 2 or 3 without relapse. I’ve been sober before and after that period I’m fine but for a year I’ve been skipping a dose or two so I can “feel the fent more” during planned relapse. From my understanding, the sub shot (sublocade? Plz correct if wrong) gives u a steady dose for up to 3 months, which as I’m typing I realize fits perfect for my lack of self control lol..

"Suboxone forever?. Hello everyone, so I am 24 years old. Female. and have steadily been on suboxone for a year and a half , but been taking it for 3 years (I actually take subutex fyi, but I still just say suboxone). I have posted something similar before, but lately I have been seeing TONS of posts about people getting off suboxone (I am proud of you!). It makes me think something is wrong with me. In my mind I feel like I will need to be on suboxone forever. When I think about the awful withdrawals I had with oxys (literally ended up in the hospital for 6days because I passed out and I considered suicide) it makes me have awful anxiety to think about ever having to go through that again. Like awful. I know so many people do it, and I'm sure I could to. I can afford suboxone, I have virtually zero side effects from it at this moment and I dont see a problem with me being on it lifelong.

 But everyone tells me my mind will change and I will eventually want to pull myself off. So my question is,  does anyone on here have like no desire to stop? Or feel they will be on it for life? Is something wrong with me for not having absolutley even 1% of wanting to quit?

"Yesterday, I informed my Doctor that I no longer needed anymore Subutex.. Here in the UK, I've been having to visit my family Doctor every six weeks before he would sign off on another six week prescription. Each Monday, I'd pick up my weekly script.

Yesterday, after 4 long years, I had the pleasure of telling my Doctor that I had successfully tapered since January and no longer required anymore Subutex.

He was shocked and pleasantly surprised that I made it through without any medical assistance. This place taught me everything I needed to know on how to successfully taper. My Doctor was unaware as I never wanted to rock the boat in the event that I relapsed.

When chatting with him, I had explained that the negatives had began outweighing the benefits with Subutex and that I decided to make a real effort to taper and eventually get myself clean. 

By the end of the appointment, he tore up my script and congratulated me on my hard fought battle to sobriety. 

Walking out of his office felt so damn liberating. Knowing that I no longer had to visit him anymore regarding Subutex, and that I was now walking out of there for the final time was a great feeling. I felt so damn proud of myself you would not believe!

Thank you to everyone here that supported me on my journey. Without this community, I could never have learnt how to taper before eventually making the jump. This place has truly been amazing.

Soon I'll be nearing 50 days clean. Each day, I'm feeling stronger physically, but most importantly, mentality.

Please if anyone knows and can help I would really appreciate it and please spare me the talk on the dangerous consequences of injecting it …",0,0,0,0,0,1

"I owe my life to Suboxone (round 2)..  I started taking pain pills in 2002.  The first oxy I took I hated it. I was prescribed Percocet once before that and felt that it made me mean and I gave them away. I couldn’t for the life of me understand why someone would want them.  Needless to say these guys at work loved me. I didn’t know at the time people used them to get high. Shoot I was so innocent at the time I didn’t even know what “getting high” meant. 
   
Fast forward to about 2003 and I got my wisdom teeth pulled and again was prescribed Percocet, this time it was different though. This time I remember getting the warmest feeling I had ever had in my life. I curled up in my girlfriends lap and she fed me Percocet as prescribed on the bottle and I was in heaven. A couple days pass and my dentist calls and checks up up on me. I managed to round up a refill out of him even tho I didn’t need it. I was hooked. 
   
From 2003-2008 I was out of control. I was spending every extra dime I had on oxy 40’s. I ruined the relationship I referred to earlier because I wanted to party. I had a son in 2006 and somehow managed to be there for the child. I can’t count the number of sleepless nights from withdrawals and then having a screaming baby wake me up at 5am. I also managed to keep a job for 14 years. It was a miracle. 
   
I got a DUI (alcohol) in the midst of this (2006) and got put on probation while hooked on pills. I went to jail for a week for having Hydrocodone in my system. They let me out and I quickly went right back to the pills. One night I was in withdrawals and the only thing that helped was alcohol. I met up with a bartender and me and her got drunk and I ended up doing meth with her. I stumble in the door at 7am just in time for my sons mom to go to work and BOOM my probation officer calls, 
   
I gotta go in for a drop. I know if I pee dirty  again I’m gone (jail) for a few months at least. So I called my P.O. and i laid it all out on the line. I tell her I’m sick. So sick that If it weren’t  for my son I would have put a gun to my head. 
  
Not even a week later I’m on my first dose of suboxone and I can’t believe it. I do take them as prescribed and my life slowly comes back together. This is about 2008. I make it through my probation which was actually Drug Court after a 4-year ordeal. 
   
Fast forward to 2013 and I’m now prescribed Xanax on top of the Suboxone. For some reason I had 3 docs (they all knew each other) that didn’t see a problem with this combination. However, who does have a problem with this is a cop that pulls me over and takes me in for a blood draw. I’m DUI (xanax) and my 5-year-old son was in the back seat.  Somehow I avoided a neglect charges and maintained joint custody. They said if I had not had a valid prescription I would have lost him.  
   
I am forced into rehab and I quit subs and Xanax in a 7-day-detox and then onto  a 30-day outpatient rehab. I complete the rehab and stay off subs. What happens the next year of my life is beyond comprehension. 
   
I’m shooting heroin daily and I have random junkies flopping in house every night. I see my son less and less. He lives with his mom full time now because I sure as hell can’t take care of him beyond a couple days a week. This whole time I’m on probation again for the Xanax DUI. I manage to get clean for the pee tests and on the way home from the tests I’m on the phone with Dope man. 
   
This continues from Sep 2013 they Dec 2015. I violate probation because I get caught passed out in Meijer parking lot huffing air duster. You see I was out of dope and I heard that huffing would take the edge off, and it did somewhat. Anyways I get another charge for huffing and they violate me. My only choice is rehab, again. 
If I had not chose rehab I would have went to prison. 

This time I take it serious though. I ask for Suboxone because I know it’s my only hope. I WILL DIE  if I walk out of that facility without it. I do another 6 month outpatient along with a 3-month jail sentence (work release ).  
   
This time something changed, something clicked in my head. I move away from the city and back to my hometown. I had to push the reset button on my life. I was reborn. I sat at home and reconnected with myself and my family.  I cut off all the toxic relationships in my life and I got a new phone number. 
   
Fast forward to 2018 and I finally feel strong enough to put myself out there and take a chance.  I quit the job that was the cause of my stress and anxiety ( not to mention filled with pill heads) and find a new job. I enroll myself back in college and I file for custody of my child. All of this while still taking suboxone. 
   
I’m taking suboxone along with a blood pressure pill and a pill for nightmares. No more anxiety meds. I’ll tell you what opiate withdrawals are a walk in the park compared to Xanax withdrawals. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone no matter how much I despise them. 
   
As of today I am on the deans list at school (A’s) and I have sole physical custody of my child. I work full time and I have my own house. My son gets straight A’s also. I will graduate with a degree in Robotics next summer. None of this would be possible without Suboxone. All of you that wanna chastise those that choose to stay on subs go ahead and continue with that self righteous BS. What works for some may not work for other.  
   
Suboxone is my lifeline and it will be until I choose for it not to be. I’m a better person today than i was when I quit taking it. For anyone that feels like they are cheating by taking subs ask yourself, what does it really matter? All that matters is that you become the best you, that you can be. If it takes suboxone to do that than so be it. 
   
Thanks for reading my story. Peace.",0,1,1,0,0,0

"Starting Suboxone this week: I have questions. I’m taking about 50 MGs of Percocet a day now - spread out over a few hours in the evening - but I’m trying to kick it. It sucks!

- How much Suboxone should I take to get an equivalent of what I take now before tapering the Suboxone? 16? 12? 8? Any recommendations on spacing the doses? 

- Does Suboxone cause insomnia for you? I already have insomnia sometimes and I’m wondering if it will make it worse or just basically act about the same as Percocet (just less euphoria)? 

- When I go through withdrawal, the physical agitation is the worst for me. Pent up, restless, jump out of my skin feeling. Will I feel this while on Suboxone? If so, what do you do to help manage it?

- How long does the Naloxone part of the medication block other opioids? Something I’m curious about in case I ever really needed pain killers. For example, I do need knee surgery at some point this year.

"Best way to come off or at least get down to 2mg daily. So I recently had a brief relapse on Rx opiates (hydro, oxy) using very high doses for about 2 mos, I felt the only way to get out of that mess was jumping on subs for a bit. I got prescribed 16mg a day and took that for the first week and have been going down for the past 2 weeks now, I'm currently at 6mg and have zero wd symptoms and it's holding me fine which leads me to believe I could go to 4mg no problem.

I started subs on Dec 7 so it hasn't been too long. If I wanted to taper all the way down and jump how would it go? Have I been on long enough to be totally addicted?

I used to take suboxone as prescribed a few years ago and went cold turkey off 2mgs a day after 2 years of taking it so I know how long and drawn out the withdrawal can be. 

My situation now is I usually take hydros for 2 separate pain conditions, but due to shitty circumstances in a bad relationship I haven't been able to get back to my doctor for refills and 4 weeks ago began taking some suboxone I had stashed away for pain here and there. 

I never took more than 2mg a day and would space 2 or 3 days between doses so I wouldn't get addicted. Well, somehow I became physically dependant again and I've been kicking them for 8 days now. 

Yesterday, day 7 I felt great besides some chills and thought I was in the clear, but today I'm back to feeling icky and cold sweats. Did I really fuck myself from 3 weeks of irregular use??! 

My second question is, would I fuck myself even more if I took a small (1mg or less)  dose to help me get through a day tomorrow?

"First day of jump - a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Here we go.   
I know, I know, you dont feel anything the first day (except anxiety mixed with some anticipation), but still feels like a big step. I've been on 4mg subutex for close to 7 years and tapered down to 0.2mg before the jump. I would have tapered lower but I chickened out. I was on 0.2mg for six weeks (the longest I stayed on a dose below 4mg) and had finally gotten a little better and less anxious but I guess it's one more ride on the roller coaster.   
I felt insanely anxious first part of the day, couldnt keep still coupled with zero energy but all that was 100% mental, I'm sure. Tomorrow I'm checking into rehab, to be on the safe side, but I have no idea when the bad stuff is gonna hit me,  
I'm assuming it's gonna be hell intensified, something close to my 0.8-0.4mg taper, but much much worse, but I dont know yet.   


So my questions is: How soon did the really bad wd's hit you on this kind of jump? Third day? Fifth day? How long did the excruciating pain last?

"Trying to transition from fent to suboxone and it’s miserable. Any advice?. Ok so let me explain to begin with. I’d gotten a little carried away with powdered fent the last handful of months. Physical addiction sucks though. I went out and got a prescription for suboxone where I’m suppose to take an 8mg film twice a day. Last week I gave myself 36 to 48 hours of not taking anything to take the film and within a half hour I started sweating bullets, feeling sick as hell. I toughed it out because I figured it was withdrawal caused by the nalaxone. It made the scared to take the other film that night so I didn’t. I was more sick than I’ve ever been. I waited till the next morning where I felt a little better and more comfortable to take the other film roughly 10am. Again after roughly 30 minutes I was so sick again. I spent that entire day in bed as well but sadly that night I faltered and got some more dope to just feel normal enough to work and stuff. 
Here’s my questions, I still have my script and I want to try to detox again. What did I do wrong, if I did anything wrong to cause the precipitated withdrawal and what can I do  to make the transition to easier? Currently I’m tapering my dosage to maybe help the transition.

"Do you swallow your spit after suboxone disolves ?. What Happens When You Swallow Suboxone?

 Opioid receptors are also present in the intestine. When Suboxone activates these receptors in the intestine, it slows down movement and the operation of bodily systems such as the excretory system, muscular system, lymphatic system, digestive system, and more. This can cause constipation. Refer again to Can Suboxone Lead to Addiction for more on the retardation of movement and bodily systems. The stagnation causes material (feces) to remain in the system for longer than it should; this, in turn, causes constipation.

Ive been taking subs now for about 2 and a half weeks (about 16mg a day) sometimes i only take 1, 8mg a day. Will i have bad WD's if i stop now?

When signing up for subs, they require your Drivers license, I hold a CDL and was wondering if that is going to pop up and be a problem even though i dont drive. But i may in the future.

"Alvogen Generic Brand?. So...I've been on Suboxone on and off over the course of my addiction for the past 10 years. This is the longest stint I've ever had not using, not drinking, not even smoking weed, just over 25 months.

Most of what I've read about Alvogen is bad. I've heard that they're not as effective, I've heard of people experiencing withdrawal symptoms, having funky urine screening results.

My major concern is the possible withdrawal symptoms. Are we talking precipitated withdrawal? Because I've been through that twice and no thank you.

Just looking for some reviews really, preferably from someone who has taken both the Aquestive/Indivior and Alvogen brands, I want to know what the differences are, and what kind of things you experienced when making the switch.

Update: Thanks everyone, I was able to confirm with my insurance company that I will be able to remain on the name brand stuff. I am advising my friends do the same. I know some people I've seen online saying that they have no issues with Alvogen, but it seems to be the general consensus that they're bad.",1,1,1,0,0,0
"Hardest to dose under the ""feel good"" level but enough to feel ""stable"".. I think the healthiest dose when using Suboxone to transition to totally clean, is the dose you feel stable and able to sleep but no burst of comfort/motivation/etc.

I've been tapering and working on being content at 0.75MG. What I've realized is the smaller doses keep me stable and I'm learning that has to be good enough if I want to taper off completely. Usually after 2-3 weeks at a reduced dose, I start getting slight ""feels good"" from the smaller dose. That's when it's time to reduce further.

I'm planning on tapering from 0.75MG to 0MG by 2023. Need to appreciate feeling ""stable"" and unlearn the craving to feel good.",0,0,0,0,1,0
"Taking my first dose without precipitated withdrawals. I want to start Suboxone again after a relapse. I’m afraid of the withdrawals and want to do it as comfortable as possible. I went to a detox in April and am going to get Suboxone from a website. Originally in the detox I’m pretty sure they hit me with about 12mg of Suboxone and tapered me each day. They made me wait over 30 hours before taking it because my pills have fetanyl in them. Sadly I’m back on it and want to get off. 

I want to know if I can take about 12mg instantly after like 20 hours as opposed to either waiting nearly 48 hours (as recommended when fetanyl is in the system). This also goes against what I’ve been reading online which is take 2mg and if you start precipitated withdrawing then take another 2mg every 30min to an hour. Would taking 12mg instead of 2mg prevent precipitated withdrawals? 

Really appreciate any feedback. Please help me get off this crap",0,1,1,1,0,0
"COMING OFF 1 YEAR OF SUBS. Hey guys I'm coming off one year of suboxone so I figured I would post my journey.
A little background I've been shooting opiates for the past 10 years mostly oxy or heroin either one. Bee  to treatment, in halfway houses several times but I didn't get results until I joined a program at my local VA as I am a veteran. I  have been a sober over one year now but I have been in AA working the steps therapy once a week,  I became a certified personal trainer I have made many accomplishments more than I ever have in my entire life but now I feel I'm ready to come off I feel like I'm a 60% of a person if that makes any sense, compared to being sober without anything, I feel as if I'm in a fog on suboxone.  Also blood work shows that it did lower my testosterone a great amount and my estrogen doubles unfortunately went up so they are fixing that as well. I have used subs as a tool, not as something relying to keep me sober. I tapered as followed from when i started to now:
Month 1-6 @16mg ( This is way too much and I do not recommend it)
Month 7-12 @8mg
Over the past 2 weeks I rapidly tapered
Week 1 was @4mg
Then 3..2.. and I jumped
Tomorow morning will be 72 hours off.
 Today I feel just general withdraw symptoms but no cravings, hot and cold hallucinations at night,  I've watched TV all day today and yesterday. My sponsor has checked on me I have a good support system. I've been through withdraw from about everything oxy heroin and so far the subs are not that bad but we shall see even with those drugs, my withdraws never lasted more than a few days I've always been in good shape and have a fast metabolism which I'm sure helps

My life is really great. I've been through so much in my life. My mother took her own life, ive experienced so much death and sadness kn my life. Depression and bipolar is in my genetics. 

Ive been one of those people that just refuses to quit and keep going as shit piles on. 

I currently have a great job, most beautiful spouse on the planet, baby on the way. But something is off.

Ive been smoking weed since I was 12. Daily. I got caught up in pills and oxy growing up, multiple surgeries. I started taking suboxone about 10 years ago. It helped me be free again. I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO A DOCTOR FOR THIS. 1 strip lasts me a week.

I currently have a new job offer and they drug test. I want this so bad for my family. I want to be the father I know I can be, and will be. I love how they make me feel. I don't think I am ready to stop just yet. I have quit smoking weed now for a few days and feel okay.

This drug test is for a car dealership, much bigger than the one I am at. If I detox off weed and stay on the subs, do I stand a chance? I do not have a doctors script, or insurance to quickly get one. 

I've tried so hard to keep my life in order despite the things that I've had to overcome. No one knows about my sub use other than my old best friend who I get them from once a month. I take 1 a week and literally have it down to hardly anything. 

I am so worried I will fail this drug test for a sliver of subs. I heard most don't test for subs. But how can I be sure?

I mean I don't know for sure I was seeing him at a Health Partners Clinic but he moved to a smaller Community Clinic, I still did a urine drug screen last time I was in there.

Has anybody successfully done microdosing on subs and had drug screens I know there's no way to know for sure that my clinic specifically won't test for it, it's just a guess I think they would look for benzos t h c opiates the bup but I don't know about shrooms.

"any advice/help needed. hey everyone. longtime lurker because i never felt comfortable posting in this sub. i was always afraid someone i knew would find my profile and see that im on Subs. the way our brains work is weird,isn't it?

so for probably the last 3 or 4 years, ive taken AT LEAST 1 Sub. i was prescribed them for about 2 of those years, the other time was being helped TREMENDOUSLY. they were 8mg

times have recently gotten tough and no matter how terrible of a person i am for being addicted to them(and opiates in general) i never let it bother my family. ill always use my money for groceries or bills before buying anything like that

i couldn't pay for my prescriptions anymore. i was using a telemedicine situation. so i used what i had from them and tried to taper. although that didn't work cause im an addict and i said ""im going to run out anyways, might as well take them like normal""

now im here with nothing. cold turkey after 4 years. i know im in trouble. today is the first day i don't have them and mentally, im exhausted. all i can think about is the impending WDs that are coming

so what are my options? im not sure i can make it through these WDs. ive seen people mention WorkIt Health, is that legit?

Questions about suboxone and oxycodone. I’ve been addicted to Oxy for the last two to three years and take 1.5 to 2 30mg pills a day. I recently have been trying to quit and decided I want to get on suboxone but the doctors want me to kick for a day or so before I can get a prescription. So I decided to go buy a strip and see how I feel. I only bought one with only the knowledge that it keeps u from kicking. Now that I’m home from work and did a lot more research I feel like I fucked up lol. My question is how long does 1mg of suboxone last for before I start kicking again? When can I take another blue so that I actually get high? Will I be able to just take street suboxone instead of actually withdrawing before I go to the dr and start the process of getting medication? I work and don’t have time to be sick and shitting and puking at the same time just so the dr will give me suboxone. That’s the whole reason I want it so I don’t have to deal with that.

"Opioid induced constipation from suboxone... it gets very bad for me. Anyone else suffer from this?. Hey all, I've been on suboxone/subutex(due to current pregnancy) for about a year now, and clean from all drugs since I've been on this medication. It has helped me stay clean and not crave for so long, it really has helped me with my addiction. The down side of it though, is I suffer from OIC very badly and I usually become fecally impacted. The pregnancy hasn't helped at all, but it gets unbearable. 


I'm currently fecally impacted, and it's the second time this month, about 5th time this year. I'm in a lot of pain, and im about to take an Epson salt bath and attempt an enema. It's gotten to the point if I eat, I throw up so I haven't eaten since yesterday and have been relying on nutritional shakes. Enemas have been my go to for fecal impaction and they usually work, so I'm very hopeful this works for me this time. However, kinda concerned that this may be a way bigger blockage, and I may have to go to the ER if the enema doesn't work. Kinda concerned I'll be in a way more painful situation if I can't clear this blockage. Anyway, I was wondering, does this ever happen to anyone else? When it gets like this for me, I become very hopeless and depressed because of the pain and the inability for me to do something that should be a natural process. 

How do you guys deal with OIC? Thanks for taking your time to read this.

UPDATE 1: just got out of my magnesium salts bath, smoking a cig for anxiety and unable to pee due to the blockage, about to get this enema done

UPDATE 2: did the enema, got 7 hard masses out, quite small, I'm sure there's more to come.

Wow suboxone withdrawal is insane. I haven’t taken any subs in about 30 hours now. Past week I’ve been on and off of it. Last thursday I took a .35 and then went the next three days without. Wasn’t too bad. Monday I took a .25 and Tuesday a 1.5 messed up that day. Wed I took .15 and now nothing in over a day and I feel terrible. The anxiety is insane. My heart races at times. I can’t eat. I can’t pass bowel. Which is odd. I sneeze really hard. My mind races. Body feels like lead. Is this going to just get worse? Before I cut down I was taking around 1mg.

"16mg day for 10 months back to IR for 1-2 weeks - help. I have been on \~12-16mg day for 10 months straight absolutely nothing else ever. Before that I was on 16mg day for 5 months and went back to Oxy IR for 6 weeks or so and have been on sub for 10 months since. Basically the sub stops working for my pain and if I switch for a few weeks it will work again for at least a few months and will slowly stop (sev spinal stenosis). Anyways the last time I switched my tolerance was super high or i did something wrong when transitioning that caused this I dont know. It basically took 6+ 30s per day to make me not sick but my pain was somewhat better.. switched back because I obviously could not continue to take 6-8 30s a day and not even feel decent however the subs then worked well for my pain for about 3 months and slowly stopped to where the last 3-4 months have been hell. My sub doc told me that about 1 years use will REDUCE the receptor count so one day I would be able to take 5-10mg and ""feel"" it again but this could take 10 months - 2 years but he thought it would be about a year or less for me.. My question is this.. if I switch now after 10 months will my tolerance still be crazy high or should it be somewhat reset? Whats the best way to figure this out? or is this bullshit? Slowly dosing the IR good? If I can get to a respectable dose I can then figure surgery out without the fear of being in massive pain while they will only give 5mg but i need 35mg per dose. For those that are concerned I have never used a street drug once in my life and all my stuff is medical related and I have no desire to feel good or anything like that ever I just cannot stand for more than 90 seconds and its life altering this will give me at least 3-5 months of relief and/or allow me to consider surgery now possibly.

"So many people are so uneducated about how a suboxone program is supposed to work. Everyday I see someone say they’ve been on subs for a month or two without any relapses and they want to get off subs already. Apparently they think they magically cured years of opiate addiction with 2 months sober with the help of subs lol. A suboxone program should be for AT LEAST a year without any relapses. 

Sure, suboxone may help you get through withdrawals by doing a sub taper for a couple weeks to get off heroin fent or pain pills. However, withdrawal is the easy part of opiate addiction. The hard part is staying clean for the rest of ur life and not relapsing and ODing.  

Relapse rate of opiate addicts is above 85% within 6 months of getting off opioids with no maintenance program. Any health organization or doctor will tell you that MAT or MMT is the best treatment available for opioid addiction right now. 

So what I’m saying is, if you think you’re ready to get off suboxone after a month or two and think you can stay sober, you’re most likely not. There’s an 85% chance you’ll relapse within 6 months. Hopefully this rant will convince someone!",0,0,0,0,0,1

Which is different because when I first started suboxone, idk 5-6 years ago it was dope, not d/fent/god knows what else, so after like 12 hours I was good to take a sub and the wds were minimum and no pwd's.

Heres the problem, Ican't get that far (MINIMUM 24 hours) Even with benzos, gaba, pot, and i just don't know what to do anymore because I'll get to 16-18 hours, be sick but I know it's not long enough, and so I go pick up because the wds are just gonna get worse from there, use, don't get high just well, and start all over. I also can't just take enough benzos to just knock myself out because, ya know, life, kids, wife (who has no clue just thinks I'm on subs still)

So I guess the real questions out of that wall of text are:

1. how can I get to 24+ hours into wds with helper meds listed above? 

2. should i even take the subs, or just wd from the dope (I don't want to call it heroin because frankly it isn't anymore.)

3. I've never wd from dope, whats it like, how long does it last typically.

4. Is it possible to do a dope taper, if so can someone help me out? I currently use between a buns (10 bags, I'm in the north east of the country)- 1.5 buns a day

5. My doc will rx any helper meds I want. Literally, probably, anything  so..(except opiates/opioids)

6. ANY other advice or anything would be awesome, positive or negative, just anything helps honestly.

"Interdose withdrawal issues, seeking advice. I've been reading around a bit here and it seems like most people can skip a dose and be ok.   This is surprising to me because I dose twice a day and even with that schedule I'm getting interdose withdrawal problems.  For example, when I wake up in the morning, I feel this horrible dread and sense of how deeply worthless my life is, along with the usual creeping physical symptoms of opiate withdrawal.  But then I take my 2mg sublingual tablet and 40 minutes later I feel ok.  (I'm prescribed 2mg tablets, to be taken twice a day).  I've been trying to take my second dose later at night, just before bed rather than ~6pm like I used to, but I *still* feel bad in the morning.   And on top of it, when I take my second dose later like that, I even start feeling a little interdose withdrawal at night time, since my body expects it earlier.   

I'm considering taking it 3 or 4 times per day at a lower dose.  Like instead of 2mg twice a day, doing 1mg four times a day.  Would that be a bad idea?  I'm also strongly considering trying to taper off, but I'm worried it will be exceptionally difficult since I'm already struggling with interdose withdrawal at my standard dose!  Sucks.

"SUBLOCADE day 20. SUBLOCADE 

Day 20, 9 days away from receiving 2nd shot 

So, it’s almost been a full month.The first week was great. I felt completely stable and totally normal. Going into the second and third weeks, I began to struggle. I would experience just a couple of withdrawal symptoms at a time, and they would stick around for a few hours and then fade away. I just kept feeling like I was going back-and-forth from feeling totally normal to feeling like I was unstable.￼ but, I will emphasize that the symptoms I have dealt with I’ve been fairly mild. And only a couple at a time. So, for example, I would be dealing with swelling and temperature changes along with diarrhea and huge lack of energy OR I’d experience gooseflesh and temperature changes along with yawning and the constant desire to stretch. But, mentally, I never felt that...panic. I didn’t feel like I was dealing with any of the psychological features of withdrawal. So, I could actually deal with it fairly well. I always had faith that I would go back to feeling normal, and that always seemed to happen.￼￼￼ Now, sleeping has been a real roller coaster. I’ll go a couple nights without the ability to fall asleep, but then I’ll be able to catch up with a good nap the next afternoon. ￼ it’s like my body is totally aware of the medication being present, but isn’t quite sure how to use it all the time. I am 100% confident that after my second shot, I will be completely stable. The second shot is another 300 mg shot, and I think that that will just fill in all the gaps and give my body what it needs. Also, I think I will be completely adjusted by then, too. 

Just a reminder, I was on 12 mg a day before I begin the shot.￼￼ I have been told that anyone under 24 mg qualifies for the shot, but I do think that towards the higher end of the spectrum, it may not work as well. But don’t quote me on that bc that’s just my opinion. 

My doctor has reminded me that if I ever needed anything, I should call. I have definitely kept that in the back of my mind, but I have not called her as I feel like it is more important for me to adjust to life without daily medication. I haven’t been feeling bad enough to need any help.￼￼ i’ve also been seeing the beauty of recovery at work, too. And that is comforting. Through those days when I’m not feeling good, I can rely on the things I have learned in recovery to get me through. I have reached out and talked to someone, I have kept my mind on positive things, I’ve taken time for self-care, and I have chosen to feel proud of myself during this time. We are all fighting the battle. We just have to choose to keep fighting, one day at a time.￼￼",0,0,1,0,0,0

"I need help convincing myself to stop. I am 27yr old male who has been using opiates consistently for 6 years. I recently went to rehab and kicked suboxone and benzos. I managed to sneak in some kratom and began using that at around day 10 to feel better from my withdrawal. The discomfort is bad but for me its the wanting to isolate myself and fear of social interaction that kills me the most. I dont like being around people when I dont feel good. After I left rehab I stayed on kratom for a few months but kratom is a strange plant. When I begin to abuse it then it will turn on me. I will start to get lots of anxiety from the kratom and it just does not feel good anymore. So back to Suboxone. That was about 3 months ago. Just like the last time I started with this shit, I got emotional and threw everything away in my life. I quit my job and now I am hanging on by a thread. I am a single father with sole custody of a 9 month old. You would think this would be enough to get me to stop. I want to but I am so afraid of failing again like I have numerous times over the past 6 years. This addiction is tearing me apart.

"Went 7 days w/o taking subs then broke today and took .3 mg. Am I screwed?. So, I think most people on here can probably relate to the bathroom issue suboxone causes.

I had this horrible emptiness emotionally- I couldn’t feel anything. Today, the chills and sweats were in full force. I’m wondering how long it’ll take for .3 mg to be out of my system and how badly this will detract from my progress? Like, will it leave my system faster because it’s such a low amount?

"Clomid for low testosterone. Has anyone used this medication to address their low-T as a result of their long term buprenorphine maintenance?

My T levels came back low, and my GP offered me topical testosterone replacement to get my levels back up. However, I haven't filled the script because of the long term effects of T replacement therapy, namely infertility (of which for some men isn't reversible once they cease their hormone replacement). Also the idea of having nuts the size of raisins doesn't really appeal to me.

So the only other options to address the condition are Clomid, or HCG. The idea is taking Clomid is more appealing, mainly because it addresses the issue at the source (the pituitary), which is where opioids exert their endocrine side effects.

Has anyone here used Clomid or HCG?  What was your experience?  Did you need an endocrinologist or urologist to prescribe?  Or could you get it off your primary physician?

I'm aware some people will come in and say ""why not reduce or go off Suboxone"". Unfortunately, my opioid problem is such that I need higher doses to prevent relapse. Presently I'm on 300mg a month of Sublocade, which is similar to 16mg+ of Suboxone. Any less than this and I end up with a needle in my arm. I've come off Sub a couple of times and had about 2 years clean in NA both times, but I still relapsed despite doing all the suggested things. It's for this reason I plan to stay on Sublocade this time.

"Recovery/MAT Stigmatized. I’m seeing more and more of something and I wonder if I’m just being overly sensitive about it.

It seems to me that folks are beginning to stigmatize recovery. Specifically, recovery via MAT. I see things like, “you’re not truly sober if you take Suboxone”; “Suboxone is not any better than H”, etc. (Suboxone, methadone, subutex are interchangeable here.) 

I would love to share my experience with people in an effort to help educate and give hope, but I don’t because I feel… well, shame isn’t the right word, but I feel something close to shame. 

My husband is the ONLY person who knows of my past addiction and my subsequent (successful) recovery. I don’t share outside of Reddit and my husband because I feel recovery and talk of MAT is almost as stigmatized and looked down as addiction itself when it’s something that should be celebrated (imo). 

I wonder if others feel this way, too.

"Off sub for 8 months but not really. Maybe I can get some opinions or info/support here. So I was on 10 years and in July got to 0.25mg and jumped. The first 4 months was the worst and one of the best times since being off. The conviction and work up to the taper and getting off, I was very dedicated! Feeling uncomfortable and pushing myself felt so new,

About month 5/6 I fell off to a deep depression and was put on a work leave during this time. My doctor tried me on antidepressants and all that to no avail. I did use medical grade cannabis vape as needed the first 4 months and decided I should stop. Didn't have any fall out from it. But started dealing with the new me after a decade. 

After I got back to work month 7, I had a slip at Christmas on 2 norcos. Then a few weeks later a small amount of sub like 0.25mg. I brushed it off and work was going better and life in January. Had a break up out of nowhere at the end of January and you can guess how that went. Ended up drinking, taking sub, mixing benzos, called out of work 2 days. I had no tolerance and this was dangerous. 

I went to my doctor and therapist as I knew I had to get help and be truthful. My doctors solution was writing me a script of subutex 2mg and taking 0.5mg a day. I caved for 9 days and stopped. Since then I have taken sub every 8-12 days sometimes two days in a row when I was very down for harm reduction...then I just say nope and not take it. Dose was 0.25 pretty low 

I've been in this cycle for a month now. I'm not dependent but I know the gap closes and I've felt it because I'll have minor withdrawls and my day 6 they go away. Mostly mental and slightly crappy feeling. Tomorrow I see me doc who thinks I'm on suboxone...but I'm really not. I just have this fight in me! 

I'm thinking of just making it to Saturday which will be a week of nothing and then giving the meds back to a trusted family member to get them out the house. Suboxone helped me but it also destroyed my teeth, gave me bladder issues and made me so complacent a lot of my 20s went by and now I'm 36. It's easy to justify being on it when you're on it.

The doctor must be registered in your state not just their state. If you live in the same state as your doc. Shouldn’t be a problem. But I’m sure I’m not the only person that was seeing an out of state doc. Just posting for peoples awareness.

"Need advice on dividing doses. Hello I am not prescribed sub but I am addicted to, i've been doing it everyday for half of a year now. I used to get the pills but now I have 6 of the 8mg strips. I usually take like 1/8 of a pill once a day. I want to get completely off suboxone so I plan to taper down with these last 6 strips. Any tips on the best way to cut the strips for accurate doses?  Also I like to plan so I want to have the doses individually in a container of some sort, any tips on the best way to store like 1/8 of a strip individually where it wont lose potency or be damaged by water etc... ? 

Also just any other tips or experiences on tapering with strips would be very helpful.

Bupe numbers.

"Very intense PWD. Hi;

I usually take methadone, very high doses (240-280mg); ran out, so decided to take suboxone I had lying around, never took it before.

I thought I was in adequate WD to take it but I was very wrong, about 1h from the 8mg dose I got the most intense withdrawal I ever experienced, even cold turkey off 280mg methadone didn't do that.

It's been around 32h now, withdrawals are still present. Around T+2h after the first dose I read online that PWD is sometimes treated with more bupre so I took a total of 40mg then.

Also sprinkling a lot of benzos on the top to help with wd. The 40mg dose helped a bit and turned it from PWD into manageable WD.

But now I want to know how long I should wait until I can take a full agonist opiate again. I understand 40mg is a very high dose, so that might be like 72h?",0,1,0,1,0,0

"Wise or Unwise ?. This source says its ok to pause a taper at  .5mg/day and recommends then  taking 1 - 2mg.   I say this is unwise.  

   [   if you’re at 0.5 mgs per day for a seven day period and experiencing withdrawal symptoms, try taking 1-2 mgs one day. This will get rid of the symptoms for that day and probably the next day as well   ]

2mg ?  Really ?    Why take 4 Times your stable dose ?  When I was stable at 1mg/ day I could get a bit of a buzz and analgesia(weak but appreciated) if I took an extra  .5mg.  Thats a 50% increase at once, it was noticeable. So were the side effects of course. 

 So I can only imagine an increase from .5mg to 2mg. It being an increase Four Fold. This just screems overprescribing. After working your butt off to get to  .5mg  you find the need to pause, thats logical. But taking a whopping 2mg dose ?    Wouldn't an extra  .25mg or .5mg be just fine  ?

"So I tried Buprenorphine.... So... I've been tapering my use. I basically quit at around 6am. The last small snort I had was about a sixteenth of a cap. Lately I've wondered if there was any fentanyl in the caps at all. I've never used intravenously if that matters. For me it doesn't. I still get very sick wo it. 12 hours later I felt a little uncomfortable and thought I was safe to take the Buprenorphine. I crushed an 8mg pill and started snorting about 1mg every 30 minutes. After the first bump I felt a little weird. No big deal. I tried the second bump 30 minutes later. About 30 minutes after that the precipitative withdrawal they warn about hit me like a brick, wall. A whole brick wall. I can't overstate the extreme dope sickness that came over me. Diarrhea, vomiting, dry heaving. Death was an option. I only made it through half of the 8 mg pill. I think I could have kept snorting more and it would have worked but I pussed out and used fentanyl to get back to normal. The taste of the Buprenorphine pill made me gag just thinking about it. I lost some motor function. I'm not high. I don't really get high. Just 'normal'. Anyway Buprenorphine is not to be played with. I don't know if this will help anyone but I don't want you to have to go through what I just did. Maybe you just have to. Idk. I quit before by just tapering my use down over the course of a month.

"need some advice with bupe.me!!!. Hey so I ran out my bupe prescription. Long story short, I truly and honestly lost 2 strips in the midst of moving, like an idiot. That shit is my lifeline and like most would agree, is nightmarish to go without. I take 1/4th a strip daily so I'd have to go over a week without, I can't find any on the street either. Anyway, my doctor and pharmacy absolutely will not refill my script early under any circumstance. Almost seems inhumane, I feel mad at THEM, although I did this to myself, especially since I've not once in my 3 years of taking it have I ever asked for early refill. 
My question is, would bupe.me prescribe me an emergency 2 strips to get me through to my next refill? Given my circumstances? Do they even have to know my circumstances? Could I get away with a lie to save my ass from bupe withdrawal? I don't know what to do or what to say or what info they already may have access to. Thank you, anyone.

"Dose wearing off too soon?. So I got prescribed Suboxone strips 8mg once a day 4 days ago due to heroin/fentanyl and tianeptine addiction. I have been prescribed the strips before about maybe 5-6 years ago but they were the name brand strips. These strips are the yellow package Alvogen strips. I’ve been dosing once a day at 8am but I feel that my dose wears off towards the end of the day, even around like 6pm. I mean my pupils even go back to normal and even get rather large around that time.

My question is should I split my dose up? 4mg at 8pm and another 4 around 5-6pm? I do not plan on tapering any time soon. It’s just weird for me because I don’t remember suns wearing off that quick. I also got prescribed subs last year for a couple years through bupe.me, although no pharmacy would fill them so I had to use their mail order pharmacy and the subs came in the form of a “troche” which is a small waxy block that dissolves the same as strips do. Those were apparently buprenorphine-naloxone 8-.2mg. So substantially less naloxone but they did not feel very much like regular sub so it was kinda weird but they did last longer.

"Can we accumulate a list of anecdotes about the (mainly psychological & emotional) side effects of long-term (1+ years) buprenorphine treatment?. I'm at a loss here and need help. I see very often on this subreddit ambiguous warnings about the long-term psychological impact of being on Subs. A lot of what people experience, both physical & emotional, is not officially researched or documented as a side effect of bup. People mention feeling burnt out, flatlined, depressed, apathetic, anxious or insomniac. Some might mention opposing symptoms like being hyperstimulated. Of course people have physical complaints that go beyond the expected constipation. In fact, a lot of research into novel side effects comes from scientists mining anecdotes on the Internet and publishing an analysis.

Personally, I've been on Suboxone for a little less than two years. I've definitely noticed some changes within myself, aside from recovery in the program, some negative psychological changes, like I've lost some illuminating spark or interior map within myself. I also experienced some aphasia / cluttering / difficulty speaking fluently before, but it's mostly abated now, and I have reason to suspect that could have been caused by something else going on with me. I'm just really curious to find out what other people can report that they have experienced, specifically, to find out what I should be looking out for.

"Horrible cold sweats 😰. Hi folks, I’ve been lurking on this fabulous group for the past couple of months now in anticipation of getting back on suboxone.
I originally became stable on 8mg after having a hefty oxy habit and remained on that for three years with very few issues. 
Anyhow, I tapered myself off and stupidly thought I could dabble in H again. Stupid mistake. I actually hadn’t used in nearly 20 years and I got sucked back in hard. After trying to get myself back on subs several times and ending up in ER with shocking PW I finally bit the bullet and went to an out patient clinic. 
The good news is that I didn’t get any PW and day one I took 12mg. Felt pretty rough but got through it. Day 2 they upped me to 24 because my COWS score was much higher even though I felt a tad better than the previous day. Today is day (night three) I had 28 today and do feel considerably better. Definitely not good, but not in pain and my stomach has mostly settled. 
The thing that’s killing me though is the sweating. I never had this previously on suboxone so I’m hoping it’s just still my body still experiencing withdrawal symptoms. My eyes are still like saucers too. It’s just thrown me as my other symptoms seem fairly well covered.
I know it’s still extremely early days but do you think this is a normal part of stabilisation? 
I’m managing to get an hour of sleep at a time before waking up in a pool of cold sweat and having to strip my bed. It’s currently 4am and have just put my third set of sheets on for the night 😢 If it was the heat of summer I’d be able to hack it but it’s cold here-  degrees Celsius (about 35f I think) and I’m finding it extremely hard. I never sweat this much even going cold turkey. 
Even during the day it’s non stop. Even though I felt a bit better today these cold sweats are really freaking me out. I’m not normally a sweater so I’m hoping it’s just all an early part of the process.
I hate the idea of being on such a high dose but I’m willing to do whatever I can to get stable and tackle the taper to a lower level after.
I just feel really confused an my non religious self is praying this is just part of the process.

"12 Step Group has really messed with my sense of accomplishment in sobriety.. On March 27 2021 I made the decision that I was done putting heroin, cocaine, and benzos in my body. I was getting clean and staying clean.  

I got back on suboxone and began to taper. I use cannabis every day and even got my medical card, and take mushrooms maybe twice a year. I don't drink.

So ever since March 27, 2021 I haven't used a single pill, line, or shot, and I've gotten down to 0.5mg of suboxone, jumping soon. HUGE accomplishment, over a year clean!

Except I spent so much time in 12 step rooms a few years ago that I can't help but feel like my clean time ""doesn't count"".  It's the dumbest bullshit I've ever told myself. I have NEVER had this much time without a relapse. Never in 20 years. I should feel like a champion! I should be celebrating with cake at my home group.

Instead, because I'm on suboxone and cannabis I feel less-than. They (recovery groups) really fucked me up. I basically have to remind myself every day that I went from a cocktail of pharmaceutical drugs (Wellbutrin, Ibuprofen, Amitryptaline, metoprolol, imitrex), with tons of side effects and perpetual symptoms, on top of runs with opiates, coke, benzos, and alcohol to literally JUST cannabis and suboxone, soon to be just cannabis. 

I'm healthier than I've ever been before, mentally and physically.  I'm in fucking recovery!

"Life without subs. My longtime dear friend ( and also ex bf from back in the day ) recently stopped taking suboxone, after a 20 year habit of opiates , subs , opiates , and back to subs . The subs were keeping him happy and functioning without cravings. I don’t know the reason , but he stopped taking subs 3 to 4 weeks ago . He has gone from being a kind , caring , and considerate person .... to a monster . He is now rude , arrogant , negative and heartless.  I have helped him countless times with money and even saved his father from losing his house ( I gave them a large sum of money ).  It’s going on one month now sub and opiate free but my question is : for some people do subs work to keep a person happy ?  Is his true personality the mean person he is today ?  I told him that the subs kept him happy and kind .  Do some people stay on this medication for life, as it regulates them?   
He has not worked except for a day job here and there . He has no drive or motivation for anything .  He lives in the garage of his parents house and is 35 but no income and no savings . I think he’s worse off today than he ever was . I paid for private rehab years ago for him but when he got out he shot heroin .  I have always been there for him , but I think the end of this chapter is upon us . He doesn’t deserve me .",0,0,1,0,0,0

Taper maybe... I am a recovering addict of one year and some plus months. I had almost 6 years before this relapse and was doing so good. This relapse was so different than the rest i’ve had before in the past.. No matter how hard i tried to quit i couldnt.. It even took me getting pregnant and developing Hep c (No longer have hep c thanks to meds) to finally get sober again by the help of rehab and now im on suboxone. I have family and loved ones that keep asking me when I’m going to get off the Suboxone or taper down. to be honest I’m scared because this time I truly want to stay sober and never relapse again and I truly worry that if I get off of it something will happen and I will slip I am finally at a point in my life where I honestly can say I don’t feel like an addict I don’t have any cravings or triggers to use drugs and the Suboxone just makes me feel like I never used drugs in my life. what should I do?,0,0,0,0,1,0

"Zubsolv has more stable bioavailability and is better for your teeth than Suboxone film (personal experience). I have been taking Suboxone films for 2.5 years. While I was on Suboxone films, many people complained about how yellow my teeth were, and some days I felt like I didn't have enough dose. Then my insurance got changed.

Miraculously, my new insurance didn't cover films and only covered Zubsolv. I've never heard of this brand before, so I tried it. Zubsolv worked much better for me, and it's way cleaner for my teeth. 

**Since taking Zubsolv, everybody stopped talking about how yellow my teeth are. So not only does it taste better (menthol), it absorbs faster (5 mins) and has more steady bioavailability.**

I wish I'd known this brand before after spending $2500 out-of-pocket for dentist repair (not including 75% insurance coverage.

Suboxone film bioavailability was more hit-and-miss, and I now realize this after taking Zubsolv. There were some days I felt like I didn't have enough dose while I was on Suboxone. I don't have this problem with Zubsolv anymore.

Check your insurance and talk to your doctor about trying out Zubsolv. I wouldn't go back to films even if my insurance covered it because it was so bad for my teeth and the absorption bioavailability wasn't stable.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Been off subs for 2 weeks... has anyone else had this strange withdrawal symptom?. For some background I did a very long taper, down to miniscule amounts, and it was much easier than I expected. I had the added benefit of moving to a location where I didn't know anyone, with very few sub doctors, so I was able to hoard up enough subs to do a long taper and now I am good. Last dose was 0.015 mg, 2 weeks ago.

Unfortunately over the past 8 weeks I have gained almost 30 lbs. Quitting smoking and switching to juice and iced tea instead of diet soda, as well as switching to another daily energy drink that has high calories, have all been part of the reason why. Weight gain isn't even the problem though, I know how to fix that. The problem is this itchy / scratchy / dry feeling in my throat that I have damn near constantly.

Doctor thinks it is acid reflux since I am also coughing when laying down and because I don't have any signs of an illness. He also said rapid weight gain can also cause reflux. But the meds I have been taking for 3 days are not helping this feeling in my throat.

"Boyfriend (34M) lied to me (27F) about being on Suboxone for 8 years the entirety of our relationship (3 years). Hi,

My boyfriend is a recovering heroin addict. He’s been sober from heroin and oxy for 5 years. 
We have been together for 3 years, and we’ve celebrated his sobriety anniversaries together. He has always promised me that he would never lie or hide anything from me. 
I found a text message on his phone from some random guy asking if he wanted “strips”. That is when he came out about being on Suboxone for 8 years (prescribed and for some reason that I can’t articulate - from this random guy).
I’ve been doing research about suboxone. I understand it’s an approved medication for individuals who struggle with heroin addiction and to refrain from using. My boyfriend has a stable job and does not have a history (since I’ve been with him) of lying and or using. 
He says now that I know he’s ready to taper down. But I can’t help but feel that maybe that won’t be a good idea. I told him to do it slowly if he really wants to but that he’s not obligated to if it’s kept him stable for so long. He’s seeing a doctor next week to come up with a plan to taper.
I just don’t know how I can trust him. How do I know if he’s relapsed? How do I know why he was buying it off the street? How can I be a supportive partner while he’s tapering? Is it a good idea to keep tabs on the amount of strips he currently has?",0,0,0,0,1,0

"My boyfriend is tapering off of subutex/buprenorphine and is experiencing restless leg syndrome/involuntary muscle movement/jerking. I’m trying to do the best that I can to support him through this process but it’s incredibly hard for me to be there for him because I haven’t personally been dependent on subutex/suboxone and haven’t been a past addict. 

He had decided to go on a scheduled taper from his doctor and has taken the last bit of subutex 4 days ago. He was fine the first day without it but by the second day he was experiencing restless leg syndrome which has made it increasingly hard to just get a good solid sleep. I feel like this process would be easier on him if he got good sleep but he doesn’t want to go back to his psychiatrist in fear of substituting one drug for another. 

He was taking subutex for 3 or 4 years and started from 8 mg down to 2 mg. He tried taking NyQuil and Trazadone for sleep but it seems like it only intensified the restless leg syndrome even more. He sat in a tub with hot bath water and instantly knocked out because his muscles were more relaxed but I can’t expect him to sit in the tub the whole day or fall asleep in it at night.

"IV suboxone Half-Life speed?. Here is a preemptive apology because I have googled this question, IV suboxone Half-Life speed reddit, about 100 times. The issue is there is no clear answer. Some say it's based on the bioavailability, which sublingual is 30% and IV is somewhere between 90% and 100%. So if that is true, the Half-Life will decrease immensely. 

Now, some more information: I just had brain surgery, a crainioctomy, and in the hospital was given 25ug of fentanyl every hour for a week an a half - then moved down to 8mg of hydomorphone and 20mg of oxycodone every 2 hours, then 4 for about 4 days and on my last two days was given firocet(sp? I know there is another I in there lol) and a rx to go home with. 
 So I have been having some breakthrough pain as well as pain from the 8 titanium screws they drove in. As my wife is on suboxone I used a quarter strip(2mg) IV maybe 3 or four times since 12/29 to 12/31. My test for my med manager is 1/6. So that gives me 1/1 -1/6 9am. I am wondering if using water, I drink 20oz x2 hr, will speed up anything if infact IV use of Suboxone does not lower the halflife time? I know someone will have done the research. I just need to be clean by 1/6 - if its too close ill probably reschedule. I've used the Half-Life calculators online, but dont know the new Half-Life if IV administration speeds it up based on bioavailability. 

Any help will be greatly appreciated. And smarter move here would be to take the pain situation to my doctor but if I pee dirty, it'll be worthless I believe. Please and thank you. Happy New Year and God bless.",0,1,0,1,0,0

I need help persevering through these nauseating mental frenzies of self-doubt, self-loathing, lack of self-confidence, impostor syndrome, and literally crippling anxiety/anhedonia/hopelessness...  I'll try to keep it short, as my story is one of multiple traumas, repressed traumas, and even current trauma (I just lost my mom unexpectedly, I didn't even get to say goodbye or I love you, fml...).  I should rent a room in the goddamn trauma ward at this point.

When I first tried using subs to control and maintain the sliver of life I hadn't fully annihilated yet(yet...), it was hellish and I gave up.  Each time I went back, it got a tad easier (maybe, could be distorted perspective from the damn dirty 30s). But it was extremely hard on the body and mind, over and over.  This is what I struggle with so severely, that I've almost died a few times. I start going crazy mentally/emotionally.  It starts with one task I need to do, and then every single thing I've fucked up/slacked on/procrastinated/ruined from addiction BOMBARDS my mind and I'm like paralyzed with anxiety and self-doubt that I can even fix/clean/pay/maintain... Then the self-loathing creeps in from hating myself for not being able to do the things I've always done to have a relatively good life.  There's no happiness most of the time, no reward system.  I work my ass off at a very demanding and high-skill tech job, everyone praises me... Yet I feel like a phony, a fake, a loser regardless.  What can I do to start feeling stronger/better/confident like I used to feel?  I can't succumb to fucking up EVER AGAIN.  This is the last pass I give myself, then it gets drastic.  So I HAVE to overcome the addiction this time.  I think I can, but I know I need more tools in my sobriety arsenal for days like this where I SHOULD NOT HAVE FUCKED UP.",0,0,1,1,0,0
Suboxone and surgery. I will be having a hysterectomy next month. The doctor performing the surgery knows I’m on suboxone but hasn’t really gave me any guidance. I know what I want as far as pain control after the surgery. My concern is being put to sleep. I have been considering cutting my dose in half two weeks before the surgery then cut that in half one week before the surgery. Then possibly one to two days before taking nothing. Has anyone experienced this? I wish I could speak to the anesthesiologist but I won’t see them until the morning of my surgery. I’m not worried about after. I can deal with some pain I just don’t want any issues being sedated.,0,1,1,0,1,0
"Take 2?. I still gotta talk to the dr to see if I’ll go back on it but I wanna know. 
So I’ve “been on” suboxone before. I was addicted to benzo/fentadope. Now I never wanted to stop smoking so when I would go to the pharmacy to get it I would take it show them and then take it out of my mouth as soon as I left with good intentions to take it later after I had smoked more and wanted to stop for the day. Then I ended up not taking suboxone at all and I quit cold turkey. 
I was sober for about 7 months and relapsed recently in the last two months. Like I said I’m not sure if I’ll do suboxone again but if I do go that route, what’s the proper way to take it? Like obviously the dr will explain everything but I just forget and want to know. Do y’all still use ? Are you cutting down bc of it ? Or did u just go straight from dope to subs? I forget how it all works and I’m dreading it but this relapse shit sucks ass",0,1,0,1,0,0
"Cold after taking Suboxone. Ok I switched from methadone last week. It has now been 7 days since my last methadone dose, but it was seeming like I would get cold every time I took the Suboxone. I found out I wasn't dosing it as well as I could be, not leaving it under my tongue long enough or whatever, but I still get these cold chills after a few hours. Am I just not on a high enough dose? Or am I just not getting enough of it sometimes? Sometimes when I put it under my tongue my whole mouth will fill up with saliva... Idk how to prevent that from happening, but it seems like it interferes with how much I get. Idk maybe I should try putting it in my lip?

Edit: I ended up leaving work last night because I thought I might have covid, and that's what the chills were from but my temperature was 98.2 last night and this morning it was 96.3 which is pretty low. It's making me worried, having a temp that low is strange.",0,1,1,0,0,0

"Question. So my friend who has barely touched opiates has been on suboxone for a year now, I have no idea why he lied at rehab. Maybe he thought it would get him high. They started him off at 4mg daily and went up to 16mg within 3 months of starting. He went down to 2mg within 2 months after realizing he fucked up by drug seeking and is now dependent, and has been steadily on 2mg for 7 months. He asked me if he were to crush the pills and smoke/snort them would it get him more of the bupe and burn off the naloxone and get him high since he was never truly an opiate addict? As a heavy fent user who takes 28mg daily currently for over a year straight now I never even thought about this because it would put me into straight withdrawal if I tried it.

"On a weeklong holiday - brought the wrong bottle with not enough pills. Thoughts on strategy to survive?. So I'm living everyone's nightmare here. Canadian, currently on a weeklong holiday to visit family in the US. I'm on 3mg a day, tapering. On the flight over I checked and realized I grabbed the wrong bottle, which only has 10 mg total in it. I'm working halftime while over here too (remote work from computer). It's 1 day in at a ""rationed 2 mg dose"", and I feel the darkness coming. I've checked to see if I can get a prescription filled here and it's looking unlikely unless I go the ER. So my options:
1. Ration it evenly. I could take between 1.5-2 mg for 6 days, then the 7th day I would be back home.
2. Front load it. Take it normally for the first few days, then go 3 days with zero until I get home.
3. Back load it. Skip 2-3 days now then resume near-normal dosing.

I've withdrawn before. I do not care about the physical  symptoms. I can shit my pants all day and be alternating sweating/freezing and this doesn't bother me. It's the depression, anxiety and insomnia that are unbearable for me. 

I also have a Valium prescription, which I am also tapering. I called my doctor in Canada about my situation and his advice was to double the Valium for just this week until I get back to take the edge off. I am comfortable with that -I've been on it as prescribed for years so am already dependant. My doctor and I both know that isn't good and are working on it but in the immediate term I need to be semi functional this week.

Pick up your subs from your preferred pharmacy.

Edit: For those that are interested in my progress, I figured I'd update:


I was on 12-16mg suboxone for around 2 years, with doses between that range during that time.

Things are going well. I had WD symtoms after the first shot beginning the 3rd day lasting another week at most, but I supplemented with Suboxone 4mg once daily during that period and I had no issues. Then all of a sudden I didn't need the extra suboxone dose, not even on the day of my next shot. Felt fine. 

I'm on my second week of my second shot and no withdrawal symtoms at all, although I must say, I have many more cravings now they I'm not ""taking"" anything. so there's that.

There's also the matter of the lump at the injection site.  I also workout more than regularly, it's a true hobby of mine, and this lump ain't cool at all, and that's coming from a married dude. I couldn't imagine being single with this thing. Having said that the second lump is much much smaller than the first as i pulled the fat up while she injected it in the center of my pulled fat. This reduced the size by about 50%. Also, beginning with the 3rd injection, the volume of the dose reduces by 66%, so assume your lump will at least be 50-66% smaller.

"2 weeks into Sub withdrawal w/alcohol w/d, too: Librium. So, I took myself to the last doc on earth that I thought would help me. I've felt like I was dying for a bit now.

"How much does it take to OD on buprenorphine? I'm worried about a friend [CW-friend is talking about suicide]. An online friend of mine who is severely depressed and struggling quitting bupe just told me they plugged 80mg buprenorphine.  Said they made a solution in alcohol of 10 8mg strips and plugged the alcohol solution.  Is that survivable without naloxone?  Since it's just a half agonist or whatever, will they be ok?  I think they also drank alcohol (vodka) and quite a bit of it.  I also know they are regularly taking benzodiazepines but don't know if benzos are involved right now (but I wouldn't be surprised).  They were saying worrisome, cryptic shit like they're ""done"" and ""ready"" an then stopped replying.  

I'd call an ambulance for them right now but I don't know where they are.   Worried about them, but hoping they'll just crash and pass out but ultimately be ok.

EDIT 23 hours later:  I got a message on their account but from their sister.  My friend also sent a message to her (their sister) who was able to get them an ambulance.  It's pretty much confirmed it really is their sister and not a ruse, but I won't go into detail.  My friend is in the hospital but apparently going to be fine (physically anyway).  Like people here were saying, the buprenorphine maxed out and fortunately they didn't take enough benzos and alcohol to cause fatal respiratory depression.  Needless to say, I'm relieved.  I'm not sure how things are going to go from here on out and with recovery, but at least recovery is possible.

"getting a script. Hi! New to reddit here, but so far it's been super helpful for me in regards to suboxone and other things. I'm just looking for advice/hear about other people's experiences with getting a suboxone script. 

I've been taking sub for almost a year and a half, buying off the street. I'm also almost 4 months pregnant and I told my doctor about the subs. She is helping me to go legit (which would be a huge relief considering it's very dangerous to my unborn child to go through withdrawal and sometimes I have trouble getting it) and I'm meeting with the prescribing doctor tomorrow. 

I also take adderall from time to time, but lower doses. This morning  at 8 am I took 10mg and my appointment is at 2pm tomorrow

So, I'm just wondering if I will be drug tested to get the suboxone script, if the adderall will still be strong enough to show up in the drug test,  and if it does, will that effect if the doctor writes a prescription for me?

"Espranor (Buprenorphine only) advice?. Hey folks.

I have posted a couple times on here and always got very good help.

I started off opiate issues with Kratom. I was oblivious to the fact that this powder was such a powerful DRUG. I had read it was a great anxiety relief supplement. I had tried ashwagandha/Beta Blockers etc and never felt relief. I mind reading anxiety and Kratom and never actually looked into how Kratom even worked. I bought some and mind i just felt that uplifting glow. Anxiety was down. Just felt a nice mood lift.

This was 3 years ago and this green sludge has destroyed my life. I only take it now for the withdrawals. I done one withdrawal from Kratom and if anyone says it's mild then i feel the complete opposite. I was ill for weeks. Couldn't work that first week. Felt like a flu tbh. I cracked and ended up back on it.

Fast forward to now and i read how a detox of opiates works. I managed to buy buprenorphine (Espranor). So i swapped from Kratom to Buprenorphine and i felt 10x better. I could dose once a day and not think about it again. Kratom i was doing 3-4 times a day. With me buying buprenorphine i was restricted to access and eventually couldn't get a hold of it. I wanted to see if i could handle the withdrawals and it was brutal also i can't deny it. I managed about 5 days and now back to the green sludge 👎

What i have noticed is.. With buprenorphine only i actually feel healthy. With Kratom i wake up EVERY morning in sweats and running nose and just feel like garbage until i dose. I never had this once on buprenorphine. I feel like the Kratom is just destroying my body/brain. I generally just feel unwell all the time on Kratom. I never feel good.

I have reached out to a drug addiction place and i am slowly getting into their system. I would have been much further in but in a previous post i had mentioned a staff member went and told my family member i had reffered myself. I panicked and denied it and never went back. I eventually relaxed and this time i have a support worker alongside me. I went through a different path this time and told her what happened and she was furious and has got me back into the drug addictions clinic with zero disclosure.

I just want to finally put away this Kratom FOREVER. I know buprenorphine is just moving one to the other but atleast i am monitored and taking a prescribed drug. I feel healthy on buprenorphine and actually like myself. Happy and upbeat. Not an anxious mess.

Has anyone else went along this path and says it has 100% been worth it? I know it will be for me personally. I spend a lot of money on Kratom also and it's just a nasty drug. I wish people could see the true side of it. I hate it with a passion.

Also to ask. How long would i be on buprenorphine before being told to taper? I have a fear that their gonna prescribe it very short term and i end up back on Kratom. Just me being paranoid i reckon. If you have a story of your journey that would be great.

Thanks for everything

"Been looking for a chart to help estimate detectability of Buprenorphine matabolites in urine sample. Either a chart or anecdotal feedback is appreciated.


Been dosing approximately 2mg per day for about a year. Now, to be honest... maybe about a week ago I took up to 3mg in a day and that could have happened a handful more times in the weeks prior. However, since the first half of this past week, I have kept myself capped at 2mg.


Furthermore, Yesterday I took about 1mg in the the morning and today I took a similar amount. I don't really feel any differently, maybe even less inclined to feel ""sleepy"" but it hasn't been long enough to sense the change in dosage. I have no work this week, in fact no work until Tuesday, so I figured this would be a good time to test the waters. It is my understanding (or mis-understanding) that many people don't ""feel"" different until 2-3 days after dropping their dosage or jumping off from dosages ranging from 2-8mg. 


I mean like, if I took 8mg today, maybe it would take longer for me to feel symptoms if I stopped tomorrow and every day thereafter.  I base this theory on increased levels in the bloods stream.



Anyway, that's a little background on my mindset and current knowledge. 


&nbsp;


**Why have I chosen to ""test the waters"" by dropping from a comfortable and stable dose of 2mg down to 1mg?**

New job, it's looking good. Not officially hired yet but was given the ""congratulations"" by the prospective employer. I'm just a waiting for paperwork and other background checks to clear. What I don't know is IF they will even have me submit for a urine screening or drug test in general. As it stands in NYC right now, a lot of employers no longer test for drugs at all, such as the case is for retailers. A google search shows that a law was passed, but the mayor has not signed it. He hasn't vetoed it either, and it seems that private sector businesses are at least following suit with the legislative winds.


On the other hand, I'm not so sure about the local government and civil service jobs. 


Obviously, police still get tested. That's pretty much expected. Garbage men too, whether we disagree or agree with that... it's at least kinda logical. Presumably anything involving heavy machinery is or will be exempt from the prohibition against testing for marijuana. 


&nbsp;

It has been difficult to determine some kind of gold standard. Like, googling ""what kind of drug test does NYC civil service jobs use"" (use/have/administer?) 


Do they splurge on testing for bupe? Even if they did, maybe it doesn't matter at 2mg. Someone at 2mg per their script told me that their doctor can't even detect it anymore during the urine screenings. So for that person at least, **evidently 2mg results in a result that is below the ng/l cutoff.**

Still, I'm paranoid... so I figure that if my chances of sliding below the cut-off at 2mg are good, they should be better if I drop my dose drastically for a few days. I figure that maybe upon hiring me they'll instruct me to report somewhere for a urine test. Alternately, they'll give me my work schedule and spring it upon me as a surprise during the day or upon arrival. 


In both cases, it's easier for me to prepare for the urine test if I'm specifically instructed to report for or if it happens at the beginning of my first shirt.  If tested, I would use the same ""internal dilution"" method which I use for THC. **This essential means, drinking enough water to piss clear and then eating, taking vitamins and drinking an energy drink to help re-introduce color to the sample.** Yes, color is part of the equation and the other part is creatine/creatinine levels. That's fine, that's why I intend to enlisting the aide of greasy food, protein shakes, and energy drinks. **That method should give me a roughly 4-hour window of clean piss.**


The more important thing might just be to ensure that THC metabolites are below the cut-off. They may not test for Buprenorphine at all. Howver it doesn't hurt to try. Bupe has a long half-life although it doesn't stick around after using for as long as weed. More importantly, **unlike weed, I have been and plan on continuing to take Buprenorphine** for the foreseeable immediate future. This is not to say I don't plan on tapering. Indeed, I've already started the taper but if I was to get hired on monday and find out that there would not be a urine test, or if I was get a urine test next week and pass that test.. I might bring my dose back up to 2mg.


Most likely, once I know I'm out of the woods with the drug test, I would re-stabilize at 1.5-1.75mg. In the mean time I have two main goals:

* Prepare myself to pass a THC urine test through abstaining (it's been a little over a week), and  ""flushing"" -- just drinking fluids daily and exercising on my bicycle.

* Make preparations for ""test day"" by having a plan to prep my body for ""internal dilution"" so that the THC and Bupe metabolites will be below the cut-off. 


The second bullet point cannot and will not be enacted until the day of the test. Like, I can read, prepare... get more info.... but there is no point in waking up every day for week, drinking enough water to piss clear and taking vitamins to bring color back to it. That said, I do plan to do that a couple of times in conjunction with an @home drug test. I have the bupe card/strip coming in the mail tomorrow. So far, I'm just taking urine tests for THC at different parts of the day to see how the results change.

&nbsp;

If it wasn't for the *possibility* that I'd be getting a urine test for this new job, I would not have chosen to drop my dose so drastically in such a short time. I'm just glad/lucky that I don't have work for enough days that I have the option to see how this goes. I want to see, if I can hold out and adjust to the new dose. If I can't then I'd raise the dose by the time I start the new job and especially after I'm out of the woods on testing.
 


&nbsp;


**tl;dr:** New job, possible urine test. Trying to find out if NYC civil service jobs that are not police or garbage men (heavy machinery) are still given drug tests. If so, I'm trying to find out what kind of test (how many panel) and if they test for Buprenorphine as well as how many ng/l is the cut-off might be.



Furthermore, it is not lost upon me that I wouldn't be here asking this question if I had opted to get my Suboxone from a doctor. I've been comfortable with my dosing regiment, although now I am more motivated to ensure that I do not go above my stable 2mg dose under any circumstance. I am also grateful that I have not felt the need or desire to touch heroin or oxy for the past 11 months and that I have two months worth of Suboxone on hand. So basically, it's easier to stop taking any opioid when I know I didn't run out. I'd imagine that I might feel differently right now (placebo effect) if I had simply run-out.",0,0,1,0,0,0
"Suboxone for ODSMT recovery. Hey guys,

I screwed up with ODSMT. It was my anti-depressant. I was on it for like 5 months and reached a daily dose of more than 1200mgs. Then, sunday early in the morning, I took my last dose.

"Going off of Suboxone, back onto oxycodone…. I have been on suboxone for about 10 days. I have the option to stay on this for the rest of the month-or go back onto oxycodone for my chronic pain…I had some questions maybe you all could help me with, since I’m new to this medication. 

I take about 6-8mg a day, and it does help me pretty well for my pain. I do like that it’s a steady amount of pain relief rather than the ups and downs of oxy, but I have a whole bunch of side effects that make me hesitant to continue it.  I don’t have any side effects with oxy (other than pain relief and feeling much more energized and less brain foggy and tired like the suboxone). 

I guess my question is this. If I took my Suboxone tonight, and choose to go back to my regular 10mg dose of oxycodone in the morning (and the rest of the day) will I get any or much pain relief, since the suboxone will probably still be bound to the receptors for a few days? I’m aware that the suboxone is technically stronger…right? Lol

How would I will be able to go back on suboxone if I choose to within a couple of days trying to see if I’m better off on oxycodone? I know about precipitated withdrawals going from oxy to suboxone- just not the other way around. Any help is much appreciated",0,1,0,0,0,0

"Suboxone duration?. Hello everyone. Just got out of detox and started MAT program. While I was at detox I was taking 4mg x3 a day. It seemed to work alright, still some withdrawal discomforts. Anyways, they now have me on 4mg twice a day and it doesn’t seem to be working out. First couple hours I feel fine, pretty much no withdrawal symptoms, but after like 4-5 hours I start feeling the withdrawal coming on (stomach cramps, nausea, hot sweats).

"Is there a difference to anyone else?. Hey! I hope you all are doing well and staying healthy during this time. I've got a question. 

I went to fill my monthly prescription and got a brand I've never had before. I went from brand name suboxone strips to Sandoz and couldn't tell a bit of a difference. Today I got Alvogen in a weird yellow package. So far I'm not jazzed with these. I accidentally scheduled my appointment a little late and ended up going 2 days with no meds until I got my script today. I was just starting to feel rough when I woke up and went to my appointment. Usually if I am short and I take a strip, I'm feeling better within an hour. I'm still not feeling right since I took the Alvogen brand this morning.

"Question about tapering off subs.. If you don't want to read the backstory and just wanna see my question go to paragraph 2 please.

I'll start off by saying I didn't start taking subs till after being clean. I got on them because I had/have major health issues that involved 8 surgeries in 6 months and am left a life long condition that causes constant pain and discomfort. So instead of taking personal or oxys for pain management my doctor said suboxone with other non narcotic pain killers would work. But now I feel like my condition has got to the point where non narcotic pain killers can keep my quality of life pretty good. They prescribed me 2 8mg strips a day but I was still in a lot of pain so I went to 3 a day. Over the last few months I've gone down to 1.5 strips a day. I've also relocated to a different state and getting subs in this state seems like it's gonna be a pain so fuck it. I'll take that as a sign.

So now that im on 1.5 8mg strips a day my question is I have about 50 8mg strips left and I would like some advice on the best way to taper down from here. I've gone down to 1 strip a day but I end up going back to 1.5 cause honestly my self control is shit. So if anyone out there can break down the best way to taper down to nothing I would really appreciate it. If possible I would like for it to end up where I taper real slow and end up with no strips left so I don't end up going back up.

"Jumping off from 0.125mg (today). Hey all, I just wanted to share my journey with a Suboxone taper because it might be a bit therapeutic. I’ve been prescribed 2mg per day for the past two years. 

Today is day 17 of my taper from 2mg down to 0.125mg. I tapered from 2 to 0.25 in the first week, which was mildly tolerable (87% total). The following 10 days of taper from 0.25mg to 0.125mg was a much greater challenge (94% total). 

I finally arrived at 0.125 a few days ago, and at this point, the dose doesn’t really even take the edge off. Today, July 13, is the day I chose to commit to kicking the subs. Well, I’m here now and today is the day. 

I have some comfort meds: methocarbamol (muscle relaxer), hydroxyzine (anxiety/insomnia), and mirtazapine (depression). I’ve done a ton of reading into these medications. I plan to take just the methocarbamol and hydroxyzine tonight to help me sleep.

"Considering Sublocade but sounds kinda sketchy. I have an appointment tomorrow with my subs doctor.
I've been on 6 mg of subs for a few months now. 
I experience little to no side effects and have been able to get my life back where it was before I started abusing opiates.
My doctor gave me a pamphlet about Sublocade and wants me to consider it.
The pros being I wouldn't have to go to the pharmacy every morning. It causes me tremendous stress. When I stopped using I broke off all my friendships with people who used. I wasn't rude or shitty, just explained that I still cared for them, I just couldn't be around them anymore.
One friend took it very personal and has been on a hate campaign ever since. They also go get methadone every morning, same pharmacy. (Small Town). I also run a business, so discretion is the name of the game for me.
Upon reading the pamphlet, it doesn't sound very appealing. I definitely do not want to lose my libido, having only recently gotten it back.

"Telemedicine to get back on subs during lockdown?. In 2013 I started suboxone for the first time, and it saved my life. I got my opioid addiction under control, and while I have tapered off several times, it's generally been a helpful medication and I have always had great results. Back in May I had a probation violation that put me in county jail for a couple of weeks, prior to their new policy of continuing Suboxone prescriptions for those who are on the medication already.

Now I am considering getting back on it again, but given the current situation in my area with coronavirus and the fact I live with and care for 2 elderly/high-risk family members, I do not want to endanger anybody with any unnecessary visits to doctors' offices.

Are Suboxone doctors able to start new prescriptions for people like me without having to see us in person as they normally would? When things return to normal of course I expect they would require all the normal things, but at the moment it doesn't seem unreasonable to be able to get back on a small dose that's worked in the past without jumping through lots of hoops.

If anyone has experience or first-hand knowledge about this please share. I bet I'm not the only one who could use a little extra support in recovery at this time.",1,0,0,0,0,0

This is going on for years now. MAT has saved me. But it’s like the reason I abused opiates was not only the Superman power we all felt at one time but cope with anxiety.

"Paid Research Study for People Taking Buprenorphine/Naltrexone in Rhode Island. Hello!

My name is Rachel, I am a Study Coordinator at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. We are currently recruiting participants for a paid research study looking at a new way to access buprenorphine/Suboxone or naltrexone/Vivitrol in a community pharmacy setting. This is a 3-month study, called the MATPharm study, comparing usual care to a new care approach at 6 pharmacies in Rhode Island. The pharmacies have the capacity to provide telehealth care and the study offers transportation assistance to medication appointments. 

The goal of this study is to expand access to these medications in areas where it is difficult for individuals with opioid use disorder to receive treatment. 

Part of the study is completing interviews and you will receive cash for answering questions about your health and telling us about your experience in the study.

If you are currently prescribed buprenorphine/Suboxone or naltrexone/Vivitrol in Rhode Island, you may be eligible for this study. Please call or text 401-408-6451 or 401-473-9286 for more information or fill out this brief survey and we will contact you:

"Can we ger agreed? SL vs Nasal. 2mg nasal is something between 3 or 4mg sublingual.
If I'm taking 4mg nasal through the day and tommorow switch to SL route - should I feel slight WD or I will be good?

Bioavailability SL is 30% of medicine.
Nasal is 48 to 50% (mixed with couple drops of vodka and you are about 70% sublingual). 

So, it u r taking 4mg SL, your body is getting 1.333mg in bloodstream.
If you take it nasal, your body is getting 2mg in bloodstream. 

If you take little vodka and disolve tablet in spoon till whole tablet mix with it - take a peace and of cotton and let it soak. 
Then you just put it under tongue and let it sit there for 15 mins. 
You're getting 70% bioavailability. 

So, this way if you take 4mg, you're getting ~3mg into bloodstream. 

And now we come to this:

Sublingual is keeping you steady for whole day. 

Taking up a in the nose - you can get through the day but you will feel as evening is coming that effects wore off... 

And if you take with couple drops of vodka and cotton - you're high like you take it nasal and it has longer effect than classic sublingual route.

"Short use question. Hello everyone, I want to preface this post with this. I have nothing against suboxone, and I know it has saved countless lives, including my own. I am been clean off of hard opiates for about 3 years. I mad a mistake of getting addicted to very high doses of kratom for about 6 months. I was able to get clean using a 6 day sub taper. I was clean for about 2 months and was feeling great but was having a lot of urges to use again.  a Dr recommended I go on suboxone for maintenance to stop the urges. I did and it definitely worked. I feel like it worked too well. I’ve since read that using subs for kratom is like cutting your foot off to deal with a sore toe (lol). I’m starting to have thoughts about using my medicine other than prescribed so I know deep down I need to stop before it gets out of hand. I am an addict. I respect anyone and everyone who uses their subs as prescribed and once again this is nothing more than a personal problem for me. Please don’t bash me as I am aware of my character defects and lack of prior research. My question is, how bad will the wds be if I stop after taking 8mg a day for 1 month? Thanks for any insight.

"Hypersexuality while doing a slow taper?. I’m a 30 y/o gay male. I started suboxone for dual treatment of chronic pain and an inability to control myself with strong pain meds. This was about 5 years ago and my pain is not as bad so I want to lower the dose. I started tapering and have gone 16 mg to 8 mg.

Add on to this that I stopped taking adderall in November, started working out all the time in December, quit smoking for New Years. All of these factors probably contribute to my my libido being out of control. However Suboxone suppressed my libido quite a bit and I’ve heard that people feel very horny when they get off of it. 

I am already diagnosed hypersexual and I am literally unable to function because it is extremely distracting and I’ve had embarrassing public erections. I’m obsessing about sex. Im masturbating and having sex with my boyfriend multiple daily just to keep it under control.

Is it normal to feel hypersexual after just lowering my suboxone or is this a bigger issue?

"Doctor has told me to take my first dose today even though I’ve used heroin a few hours ago.. scared. I went to the clinic today to start treatment and have been prescribed 8mg buprenorphine and was told to go get it from the pharmacy today to take it. I’ve done a bit of research and all I see that it’s best to wait around 3 days before starting to avoid precipitated withdrawal and I’ve used 3 bags of heroin today and I really don’t want to go into precipitated withdrawal… I told the doctor and he said to just take it because it will only last for one day and to take paracetamol… I’ll be supervised to make sure I take it too so I don’t know what to do.. I have my prescription for 4 days until my dose is reviewed so should I just not go in until Monday? Just take it and deal with it? Sorry if this has been asked before but I’ve never been in treatment before and feel really nervous.  Thanks.

Update-
I managed to wait long enough to take my first sub without getting precipitated withdrawals, thank goodness. Thank you to everyone for giving me the correct information that helped me to avoid it!

"Anyone else use Covid to kick?. So at the beginning of Covid in March of 2020, because my wife was stuck at home with me, I had no real choice but to kick. Seemed like the perfect time to go through hell -- missing nothing in the outside world. I watched the entire tiger king in one, awful day dopesick as a dog. I waited three days, took sub, went into PWD in the middle of the night, and kept taking sub till finally I started feeling better in a week. I don't plan to come off subs any time soon.

I eat once at night just so I can take my vitamins but then I wake up really really nauseous.

"What to expect with a hiccup in my routine. I have been on Subs for about 3 weeks when I had a workplace incident (too much to explain) that left me with fractures, bruises and a small laceration. I went to the ER and got a hydrocodone prescription and have been on those for two days and not taking my subs. I went to my Subs doc today and she said that I need to go into withdrawals again before I resume my subs or I will have Precipitated withdrawals. I am going to use the subs to manage my pain. Is that right, that I will go into withdrawals again when I quit take the hydros? Do I need to wait for withdrawal symptoms when only off subs for two days? I was confused by that and should have asked more questions when I was there.

1. My DOC before subs was Tianeptine, not a true opiate but it binds with the opiate receptors when taken in very high doses.
2. I have only been on hydros for two days, 10/325 every 5-6 hours, so 9 doses total after tonight.

"Cold turkey not by choice. Hey all! I just wanna know what I can do for this debilitating anxiety I’ve been having since being forced to cold turkey. TL,DR at the bottom since it’s kinda long. 

Okay some backstory. I’ve been a heroin/fentanyl addict for about 8 years now. I had almost 2 years clean when I relapsed and stayed out for a year on fentanyl while being on methadone maintenance. I went to detox and rehab and they don’t do methadone so after a few days of pure agony I was put on suboxone maintenance. I was gradually increased to 20mg a day. I’d been on subs for about 6 months at this point when I relapsed on heroin and ended up in detox. I was tapered off the 20mg in 7 days. It’s been almost a month now and my anxiety has been so bad I’ve been unable to function. I can’t eat, sleep, or work due to it. It was so bad yesterday I had to go to the ER where I was given 2 doses of Ativan and 1 of Valium and my anxiety was slightly lessened. However, when I woke up this morning it was back in full force. I’d had a hunch this was all withdrawal effects from stopping the subs on such a high dose without a proper taper, so when I found an old sub in my room I took it (4mg) just to see. Lo and behold it worked. I’m probably going inpatient for my anxiety which is honestly making me suicidal and I’m not sure if I should ask to be put back on a low dose to properly taper or if I should just keep waiting it out until this abates. The only problem with the 2nd option is I can’t function like this and it seems to be getting worse every day. I’m afraid I’m going to kill myself because of it. How long will this last? What has helped some of you when dealing with it? Should i just bite the bullet and go back on? Any help is appreciated. 

Here’s a list of things/meds I’ve tried in the last 3-4 weeks. 
-daily exercise
-daily meditation
-getting out in the sun
-going to meetings 
-calling my sponsor and recovery friends
-propranolol
-metoprolol 
-seroquel
-trazodone
-thorazine 
-gabapentin
-kava
-kratom
-buspar
-vistaril
-benadryl 
-cut out caffeine
-snuggling with my pup
-deep breathing
-repeating different things to myself, ie “this isn’t gonna kill me” “I will be okay”, etc. 

I’m so lost on what to do. Any advice is appreciated. 

TL,DR: I was on 20mg of suboxone and had to taper off it in 7 days at an inpatient detox. My anxiety has been out of control and I can’t keep on like this. I’m afraid I’m going to kill myself because of it. How long will this last? What has helped some of you when dealing with it? Should i just bite the bullet and go back on?

"Experiences with Androgel and Suboxone. Currently on 2-3mg of Suboxone per day and have been on this dose for about two months. In my last visit with my doc about two weeks ago, I mentioned that I wanted my testosterone tested and it came back at 140 which is almost 4 times lower than my last test (I'm 30 y/o now and last test of T was when I was 26 or so).

My doc started me on Androgel today (1% once daily) and I want to know people's experiences with this while on Suboxone. I'm going to continue on the gel while tapering off the suboxone about .5 mg per week. So 2.5mg sub this week, 2 mg week after, 1.5mg week after, etc. I'm hoping that the tapering of Suboxone and the addition of the androgel will help my T levels significantly as I've had almost no sex drive lately and have noticed a lot of decreased motivation in the gym and in general. I've always been an athletic guy and used to go to the gym twice a day but its been a struggle for me lately and I've just felt overall less motivation to do anything really.

Curious if anyone has run androgel along with a Suboxone taper and what your experience has been like. How long until I start to feel a difference with the gel? I'm getting my T levels tested again in a month, should I expect a significant increase by then?

"Where I'm at with subs right now and where I want to be.. So I'm trying to quit Kratom. I've used Kratom for about 4 years. Typically 30 grams a day.

There is a wide variety of alkaloids in the Kratom plant so who knows what all the other shit in there does to your brain? Scary. Like WDing from multiple substances IMO.

"Terrible headache/ migraine/ kind of like a hangover headache. So I started subs on Wednesday after a 7 year pill addiction.

All I know is I would feel a hell of a lot better if these headaches would be gone. Other than that I feel happy about the switch, the subs don’t make me feel high or anything. I know I’m still taking a drug, but I legit feel sober.",0,1,0,1,0,0
"Tapered down to .7 mg!!!. I always have loved reading posts like this sooo many months ago I first started my taper. A little history been on/off (mostly on) some kind of opioid for over ten years. I was drowning quick and saw it unfolding before my own eyes. 
Finally made a decision (w/support system, CBT & SMART therapy, subs, good nutrition & exercise) to stabilize and work on myself. Spent a year with 3 relapse (1 time only, not binges). 

Then started feeling like some on here. Suboxone is an amazing maintenance med but after about 6 months on 12 mg a day I felt so stuck and numb in life. Yeah I was doing better of coarse but I knew I was still on a potent opiate. So I decided to start my taper, slow n steady, instead of previous attempts. Most of it was a walk in the park compared to jumping off black/fent or even methadone/high suboxone dose. 

At 2 mg it got real tho. Foggy head, anxiety, insomnia, body aches, restlessness and insomnia, lethargic/severe fatigue, nausea and severe headaches….all that good stuff lol. Yet the last two days, I know I push thru the woods. Went from 1.05 to .7. Gonna stabilize fully for at least a month then hopefully 1-3 more steps before the jump! We all can be opioid/opiate free!

There’s all kinds of ways to do it but this method has helped me with my root issues that made me get so deep in the first place, get a job, car, etc getting my life back together without cravings and severe withdrawals and PAWS. They served a purpose but can’t wait to post my jump success and hopefully this post inspires like I have been before on this thread too. ✌🏻",0,0,1,1,1,0

"First Post - Day 4 off of Subs!. Hi all! You may have seen some of my comments over the past few months talking about how I was going to taper & get off of suboxone by the summer. Well here I finally am!

I started at 8MG but stupidly went up to 16MG, so I had to taper down from there. 16 back down to 8 took way longer than needed, I think I was overly cautious. Once I was down to 8 again I dropped what I could each week (usually a MG, then I cut from 4 to 2 quickly). Once I got under 2MG I usually cut about .25 each week. Excluding the overly long drop from 16 to 8, it really only took about 4-6 months tops. 

Given the current circumstances, I was able to finally jump from .5MG now that I don’t have to worry about work for a little while. Ideally I was hoping to jump from .25 or lower, but the opportunity finally presented itself this week to jump without having to worry about ANY other obligations. 

The past few days have been ok. Restless legs, low motivation/laying around, stomach issues ofc and some sleep disturbances, but nothing compared to heroin withdrawal. Sex drive comes back all at once, too, in a major way. But it’s been entirely manageable with comfort meds like clonidine, trazodone and gabapentin. Day/Night 3 of sleeping was the worst because my stomach hurt and I tossed and turned more than usual, but I slept like a baby last night. 

I know it doesn’t sound that bad, but I still don’t know if I’d be up to working during this time. The low motivation is the toughest part. However, I definitely am getting some energy back today already. I’ll keep you all posted! Happy to answer any questions 😊",0,0,1,0,1,0

I stopped my suboxone a little over 40 hours before my surgery, my doctor said a day should be fine, I’m only on 3mg. The surgeon prescribed me 7.5mg norco. 
I took two immediately after waking up, two when I got home, and two a couple hours later. Nothing. If anything a bit of a racing heart from the pain and possible withdrawals from the subs. I called the surgeon to say I was still in pain and he told me to take Tylenol (even though each of the norco has 325mg Tylenol). 

I knew my tolerance would be high but I didn’t expect this. I know it’s not all in my head because I’m peeing easily, when I can’t pee that’s my sign of being on an opiate.

"HELP!! Subutex dosing questions!!. Hey, so I recently got into subutex after a pretty bad pill habit. 100mg of oxy would keep me normal and wasn’t getting me high anymore, so I knew it was time for me to quit. I’ve been prescribed suboxone before but this is the first time I’ve been on subutex and I have to say it’s the best decision I’ve ever made in my life. 

For starters, my depression is almost nonexistent. This is something I’ve struggled with my entire life , even before my pill problem and I’ve tried SO MANY types of Anti depressants and medicines so far nothing comes even close to what subutex can do for me. With that though, comes a few concerns. When I was on suboxone it didn’t do A SINGLE thing for my depression, in fact, I want to say it almost made it worse. Is this somethings that’s common? 

And my most important questions are for my dosage. I’m on 8mg right now and I’ve felt it enhance my mood, energy, and I just get this sense of a better quality of life I’ve never had before, but some days not so much anymore. Before it was 100%, but now it’s 5-6/7 days it works fine but recently I would take my daily dose and would find I felt nothing one or two days out of the week. Granted, I wasn’t sick and going through WD, but I still miss the bliss that comes with my subs. I know everyones brain chemistry is different but I almost feel like these were made to keep me sane ITs come to the point if you had a roxy in one hand and a sub in the other, I’d take the sub. 

I tried to go up to 12 mg and see what that does for me but as far as I can tell it felt exactly the same as 8mg. I want to try 16 but I know that subs have a ceiling effect and don’t want to be wasting my stash when I could be saving it for a rainy day. I take my dose basically in 24 hour increments and just pop the entire tablet under my tounge and let it sit there for 30 mins. If I feel okay I’ll add another 12 hours before I take my medicine and it’ll usually hit me a little stronger. I’ve heard after a while Youre not going to feel anything from the subs and that’s scaring me bcs saying that this pill is a life saver is an understatement and it would be my nightmare if it didn’t give me the boost it does now.

As the title states I’m gonna be out for a little bit, hopefully this will remind me not to take extra doses if anything good comes out of this… I’m thinking about getting some kratom as I am a major p*ssy when it comes to withdrawal. Is there anything else that will help that I do not need a script for?

Thanks for taking the time to read this and any help or wisdom is appreciated…",0,0,0,1,0,0
"just about to give up on life.. No doctor will ever help me. 10 years of methadone fentynl oxycontin Norco's and 6mg of clonazepam. Taken off cold turkey 4 years ago. Every day has been a battle since. I've tried as hard as I can to get clean. I can't do it and function. I relapse and buy this shit off the street now. Well was just using Kratom but am sick of it. I buy street subs and Xanax. 
 I worked so hard at getting into only clinic In my town and can't get in because I can't pee in a 4minute window of time. They won't do anything but urine and it has to be that way. They told me take my time pee and I'd get a script then change it by end of the week. Never had a chance. 
 I just think I'm going off myself now. It's too hard to beg for help to get to were I think omg they are finally going help then they don't. I can't do my college classes with this going on. I'm a failure. I don't deserve help. I have no friends. I'm a nobody. No point in trying to pour my soul out to ask for help only to get this same bullshit. 
 Rehab is even worse. Coming off benzo I can't function for at least a year or two. Seriously can't go on. Fml. If you get help you should just give an extra thanks to gods or whatever. Be glad your body isn't falling apart. Be glad you have people to talk to. Be glad if the medical industry didn't do this to you. Don't be me.",0,0,0,1,0,0
"42 days off sub/good and bad. So you can read my old posts for background if needed. So at 42 days! How does it feel, not in withdrawl and able body for sure. But a few things I didn't expect this far out. 

Stomach issues happen but they aren't enough to ruin the day. I'm late in the game but didn't start Imodium till after day 30. Mostly take it at work or on a busy day. It's mostly for bloating and feeling the need to go...I've tried every other med and it's the only one that can hold me over for 6-8hrs. 

The worst right now is I'm getting the adrenaline rush feel again at 4amish...I had early on. It's random but some nights I'll just get adrenaline/anxiety and try to force myself back to sleep. I for the life of me can't sleep past 9am on even a day off. Usually I'm bed by 10pm and 11pm-12am on weekends. Sometimes during the day will get the rushes at random and they feel like mini panic attacks or drifting to a dark side of my brain for 5min...it just feels pretty intense at times. It's like everything is sped up.

I'm guessing some of this may be PAWS this far out? If anyone who has experienced this please give some feedback. Interested in how you handled this and how things got better or worse. 

We all focus on those first few weeks, and sure that's a hard part. But the after mental part is something else, once you go back to life. Especially for long term patients ",0,0,1,0,0,0

"Only taking 1.25 mg now. Terrified of quit.. I have been on Suboxone for nearly 6 years (before that, I was on Heroin for 7 years).

Last year, I was talking 16 mg, now I've weaned myself down to 1.25 mg. It's getting harder as I get closer to being done. I'm super scared. I don't want to go through withdrawl again, I'm 6 years past a time where I was in heavy withdrawl twice a week. Just thinking about it is traumatizing.

But, I have to do this. I don't want my past to follow me around any longer.

So, how hard is it going to be? I need to prep myself. Is it going to keep getting harder with every cut down? Is it going to be awful for WEEKS after the very last one? I have the ability to take a week off work and get a hotel room and just smoke a ton of weed. Should I do that right away after my final cut down? I heard somewhere it's the second week off of it that is the worst. Should I wait till then to take off work? Any suggestions on how to get through this? Exactly how small should I cut down to until the last leap?

I'm sorry, I know I sound like a baby. In addition to the fear of withdrawl, I have a lot of PTSD from terrible things that happened to me during withdrawl, and the resulting PTSD.

"Should I stop suboxone to have surgery?. Hi sub friends. Next week I am having facial surgery which will leave me with about 7 stitches on both sides of the inside of my cheek and an additional 8 stitches under my jaw. The pain is supposed to be pretty intense the first three days and I should be feeling okay come day 7. When I spoke to my suboxone doctor about this, he said I have two options:
1. Up my dose of suboxone for the first few days and potentially take gabapentin for breakthrough pain
2. Stop my suboxone doses a couple days before surgery and take the pain medicine prescribed by my surgeon. 

I initially was thinking to just up my suboxone dose but after dealing with some bad back pain and the subs doing basically nothing to help it, I’m on the fence. My surgeon prescribed me 30 7.5mg hydrocodone. Does anyone have any experience with this or insight? I don’t want to be in a ton of pain and anyone who has had mouth pain or surgery knows it’s miserable. I also don’t want to suffer through two days of withdrawals only to find my tolerance is too high for the hydrocodone to do it’s job. I’m on 3mg (1.5mg 2x) daily for what it’s worth. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!!

Side note- I am also concerned about PWD’s for when I stop taking the hydrocodone, advice for that is also appreciated if I do take that route.

I’ve been on pain meds for almost 6 months now and went into withdrawal because I didn’t know you just can’t stop taking them after being on them for this long.

"SO went from a fourth of one 8/2 strip to one half strip of 2/0.5. It’s been only 5 days and were already seeing big changes!. So has been wanting to get off subs for a year and finally found the courage, after all my research and pep talks. The first day he was groggy, minimal physical WD symptoms, more so anxiety and worries. We spent all day laying in bed, talking it out and rubbing his back to calm him down. Yesterday was day 4 and I had “the notebook” on when he got out of the shower. He’s usually impartial to sappy movies but he sat down and watched it. We got to the end and he was like, “my emotions feel weird, I was this close to crying at the end”. This is coming from someone who admitted he didn’t cry at the most recent funeral he attended. 

He’s usually affectionate but what I’m dealing with now is something else, he has been the BIGGEST sweetheart, constantly holding my hand, snuggling, talking about our future in the sweetest ways, just overall different. Better different. 

The best part: I’m usually initiating sex, I’ll usually throw my hand over his junk and start rubbing, it’ll either take a while for him to pitch a tent or he’ll tell me he’s not in the mood. But yesterday I did it, immediate hard on, he made more noises which were reassuring, more grabbing and squeezing while I went down for a couple minutes and the second I hopped on it wasn’t even a minute and he blew. Super sensual cuddling to follow. Afterwards he was in shock how much he enjoyed it and sat back and said “I’m starting to feel more, and it feels good, this is good, I think I’m gonna be alright”. 

He’s been off and on putting this process off, he’s expressed desire to do this but was terrified of being without it. I knew this is what it would be like and I wanted it so bad for him and for us, but I never shoved, only gave patient suggestions and unconditional love and support for him goin at his own pace. I feel so happy for him and wanted to share with anyone struggling his story to show it can be done. He was SO scared for this and it’s all panning out wonderfully.

I am still balancing out, though it is nice the physical symptoms have basically disappeared. MAT was a lifesaver and enabled me to take therapy seriously. I have found therapy is hugely beneficial, and will keep up the rest of my life. I have even returned to college to complete my Master’s Degree.

"45-Day Taper From 4mg to Zero. It's been a minute since I've had to taper off of suboxone and was curious if any of you have found success in using the 45-day taper schedule. 

The taper schedule I found online:
2mg the first week
1.5mg the 2nd week
1mg the 3rd week
0.75mg the 4th week
0.50mg the 5th week
0.25mg->0.13mg split the final week

I have the film strips and I'll have to follow the volumetric dosing steps online for the last 2-3 weeks while it's under 1mg each day. 
Part of me wants to just rip the bandaid off and get stable at 1-2mg if I can and jump from there, but I don't want to risk everything if I'm in bad withdrawals and end up making any poor decisions. 

This is my 5th time on a suboxone maintenance plan and I'm ready to be done with relying on a medication that causes so many negative side effects. I'll have a program and meetings/sponsor alongside the taper. 

If anyone out there has successfully utilized a 45-day taper and stopped taking subs completely I'd love to hear how it went

"Low doses. Ok so I wanna give my 2 cents about subs was on them for over 3 years and am currently again on them anyway iv been on every dose even hairs off strips I gotta say less is more but the problem is getting to that less if you’re an addict you gotta ween down and stay there for at least a. Few days to get full effects. 

Also another thing I wanna mention when taking less than 4mg i have personally in my experience noticed it takes longer to work sometimes it takes a full 90 minutes when taking a low dose I used to wake up sick and take a hair off a strip and not be high for a few hours. Obviously I don’t get high anymore off subs. That was before I did heroin.

“Snorting subs”
Yes it’s possible you mix with water in a spoon only a drop of water and don’t use a toothpick to mix it up it absorbs the bup.

“Adding up doses”
The reason imo it works better in low doses is it’s a full agonist below 4 mg also it lets your tolerance go away 8 mg of subs will build a ceiling less than 6 is the way to go. Obviously if you don’t want to get high don’t do this but personally idc I like them and it’s better than me dying from an overdose If people judge they judge fuck em!

“The best dose”
Everybody wants to know this I am no doctor this is my experience I was much happier taking literal hairs off a strip everyday than taking 4 a day it’s a weird drug. Google “suboxone receptor chart” on google images the less receptors sat on by bupenorphine the better the only way to get high on subs or if you did before and want to again is to lower the dose to below half an 8 mg strip a day. The best dose in my opinion is between 0.25mg and 2mg in my experience anything over 2 mg doesn’t give the buzz you want.

Also feel free to comment im just a guy lol I’m sure iv missed some shit but I have done a lot of research over the years but I’m 25 I’m sure others have more experience so feel free to put your experiences in replies👍👍👍

"Starting subs. So long time heroin/meth user 26F was clean since 2017 no subs no maintenance nothing. Then back in April I used heroin for the first time in over 4 years. Was only supposed to be like a one time thing(yeah right) but then of course started getting sick and dependent on it. Continued using. And smoking meth occasionally. Anyway today is my first day starting any treatment. Before when I was using I never had to go through any withdrawal because I had overdosed and was in the hospital for almost a month and went through withdrawal all while in there when I was out of it and don’t remember anything. Never got on any maintenance after that just stayed clean. So yeah I really fucked up this time cause now I’m dependent on it.

Took 4mg more over a hour later and I think its finally starting to help but I’m not sure. I honestly still feel pretty shitty and am having cravings. I feel really weird. Is this normal?

I waited the 30 hours my doc said to and then took a single 8mg strip. It didnt do anything much besides make me a bit more sweaty so I took a second one (16mg total) as the doc advised to do if the first didnt stop the WD.

HOLY SHIT did that open the flood gates. Ive never been that sick before in my life, not even going cold turkey on a gram a day habbit and this time i was only on 250mg. I tried to take another 8mg as soon as I could make it out the bathroom but it produced no effect other than a little extra sweating.

the first two strips were 76 hours ago and the third was 48, I havent taken anything since. The worst of it is over but Im still sweating off and on and havent been to the bathroom since the initial dose, not to mention the weakeness I can hardly crawl out of bed.

I guess my question is how long wil this last? Ive never taken subs before but I understand they have a long half life. Am I just oke for now because the strips I took havent started to pull off my receptors yet? Am I in for another bout of sick in the next day or two?

"how much Suboxone?. Hey everybody.

&#x200B;

So, I used to be on 12 mg Suboxone daily back when I did oxycodone. But for the past half year or so, I started doing heroin, about .5-1 gram a day. I am really eager to start up Suboxone treatment again, considering that methadone isn't an option for me and I feel that I really can't afford to keep up my habit. But my problem is, that I am really scared no dose will work for me, because the couple of times I tried taking Suboxone instead of heroin (last time I'd say about 3 months ago), the Suboxone didn't work at all, if I remember correctly, it actually just made me feel even worse. Those times I took 12-16 mg. I was told by the doctor at the addiction center offering Suboxone, that they were sure the problem just was the dosage, and that that just needed to be upped.

&#x200B;

So what dose do you guys think I should start with, to not feel any discomfort from withdrawals? I, myself, thought of saying fuck it and just start straight on 24 mg, but idk, that's double of what I did back on oxys, but at the same time, my use has also went from 160 mg oxycontin to 1 gram of fent-free high-purity EU #3 dope.

I'm a dedicated meditator and I have been meditating on a variety of drugs, and ofc without them as well. I've noticed that suboxone really change my thoughts in a troublesome way and wonder if anyone here has experienced something similar? 

Let's say I meditate and I experience thoughts related to my current life situation: I worry about my job (for example) then I take suboxone and the worry dissipates and is being replaced by an interesting daydream. Pretty normal and expected effect, but what happens if I am on suboxone 24/7/365...?

**My guess would be that the real thoughts/feelings are hidden underneath the sub...?** I find that a bit disturbing, because I think we really need our true thoughts and feelings to navigate our life!

I just spent the last 9 days tapering down by 50% daily, until I reached 0.25mg, which I’ve been taking for the past 4 days (before bed). The first night on 0.25 was horrific. I barely slept. I had awful w/d symptoms for the first three days on 0.25mg/day. 

Yesterday, I finally had the first glimpse of ‘feeling normal’ since the taper began. Last night, I was reluctant to take my dose at all because I was feeling the best I have so far. I ended up taking the 0.25, or if anything, slightly less. 

I’ve been anticipating jumping off ever since I began the taper. I’m currently wondering, if maybe now is the time to do it. Alternatively, I could try dropping down to 0.125mg, maybe try that for a couple of days and then perhaps jump from there.

"Does anyone have a positive experience with antidepressants while on Suboxone?. I did search all the sub Reddit‘s for antidepressants posts but everything is pretty old. I’ve been on Suboxone for a long time, about seven years. I take between 1.5 mg and 2 mg a day. In my experience, whether it’s Kratom or antidepressants or what have you… Suboxone blocks the effects of everything. Does anyone have positive results with antidepressants while on Suboxone or is it a complete waste?

I don’t want to be sad, I don’t want to be a homebody to the point where I feel like I’m going to be afraid to leave the house. I just am so sick of feeling this way. I just want to have energy and motivation to do stuff. Anyways… I’ve taken many different antidepressants over the last five years or so and I usually stop taking them around the six month mark… I read reviews of people raving how their lives changed and I just cannot wait for that to happen to me… Then nothing happens. I’m wondering is it the Suboxone and blocking it? Or have I not found the right antidepressant. Any help is appreciated",0,1,0,0,0,0

"Help!! Can u substitute opiates to obtain abstinence?. What up fam? I've been in the sub clinic for about 6 months maintaining an average dose of 8 mg/day.  Last week, I stopped taking them for a total of 4 days and used fentanyl.  It was def a decision I regret.  I looked up the burnese method of induction, where a person maintains fentanyl use for the first few days while microdosing suboxone and slowly building up their tolerance. I am on day 4 of microdosing sub at 1mg so far today.  I have not used fentanyl in 2 days. No withdrawls of any kind! 

My question is if I stop taking the suboxone, will I experience a terrible withdrawal? I may have issues getting a prescription bc of a potentially dirty UA and I have been long to stop using suboxone to break my reliance on the use of daily opiates.

Has anyone ever substituted an opiate for another opiate and only used the new, substitution opiate for a few days and abruptly stopped? I don't care what opiate it is, I just want to know if this theory actually works to stop all opiate use without experiencing withdrawl or at least making them tolerable enough to be able to fully quit.

"Kratom before Suboxone precipitated withdrawals?. So this is something I've been curious about for a while but haven't been able to find any reliable information about. 

Yesterday my new sub Dr. insisted that going from Kratom directly to subs would throw me into PW and argued with me when I told him it wouldn't. 

My last dose of Kratom was about 3 p.m, I took 8 mg. Of sub by 4-5 p.m and as usual didn't get the slightest bit sick. 

I've switched from Kratom directly to subs hundreds of times and this has never happened, even when going from 100 or so grams a day directly back to subs without skipping a dose of Kratom. 

Am I the only one? Has switching ever thrown any of you into PW? 

Can anyone explain why it would or wouldn't?

I know the alkaloids in Kratom stimulate opioid receptors, is it possible they just don't ""stick"" like say oxy or h, therefore don't get removed when the bupe comes in?

I also wonder why I felt fatigue almost 2 months after my last sub dose even while using Kratom, then got all my energy back an hour after restarting subs. It's odd to me bc Kratom has alkaloids that give you energy but subs are only supposed to effect the opioid receptors right? So shouldn't I only be getting energized with Kratom and not the other way around?",0,1,0,1,0,0

I've been using them for about 3.5 years, no doctor and no prescription just bought off the streets. My dosing has fluctuated during the time period, like on average I'd say I'd do two 8mg pills a week during the length of time I've been using them. My drug use has never been anything hard nor have I used anything for for as long as I have subs. I'm just tired of the wasted money and overall just done the whole process of obtaining the sub. My only experience prior is I was on pain pills for about year and I never had any withdrawal coming off them. Being a veteran I feel my mind is stronger than most and I know the mindset is one of the most important things to have during this process so I feel I'm just freaking myself out about the sub withdrawal. Really the worst symptoms I've had when I couldn't get the sub was diarrhea, restlessness, fatigue and anxiety. I hear vitamin c, water and anti diarrheal meds are your friend through this process. Has anyone had a decent experience cold turkey or any helpful hints? Lastly I have 2 suboxone 8mg strips and 1 subutex 8mg pill left and I feel this is more than enough to maybe do a taper like I could literally quarter the strips and the pill which would allow me to basically do a quarter every 7 days until everything's gone which is 12 weeks of tapering.

"I think it's time..... So I've been taking subs for like 6 months but not to get off heroin or pills. I actually had about 2 years clean before I started taking them. I started taking the because after a series of unfortunate events I'm left with a condition in my legs that causes pretty severe pain all day every day. So rather than taking a bunch of opiates a day which I know would turn into a mess eventually, my doctors suggested subs. They work great for the pain and help with cravings and just make life better. But I've had to make a sudden move to Florida and it's been nothing but non stop worrying about being able to get subs in Florida. My doctor was cool enough to prescribe 3 a day to me before my move so a 28 day supply is like 84 plus I have like 30 that I bought just incase.

Get some pre-treatment meds then Stay in hospital for 30 hours about and they put you under sedation for 5 hours and release you morning after.

"Major Sleep aid During Taper/Jumping Found. If you’re like me, the difficulties sleeping are the worst part of tapering your dose and withdrawing. It makes functioning impossible. I saw a post recommending L-THP to help with detox, so I did some research. I failed to sleep with much smaller dose jumps previously. I don’t sleep as well as I can at a normal dose, but I am able to still wake up well rested after taking a small dose of this. I’m currently sleeping every night, all night after a 35% dose decrease. This is still pretty experimental and a bit radical of a solution, but I’ll take it over getting addicted to Xanax. Do you’re on research, but it’s been a game changer for me.

"Suboxone tapering and anxiety. Hello, this is a long story but I’ll try to keep it brief. I’ve been on suboxone for 2-3 years- 16mg strips. I take it in 4 x per day. It was so helpful to me until two weeks ago. All of a sudden, I’ve started having severe anxiety and panic attacks out of nowhere. It started as a panic attack and then it rolled together  with all day anxious thoughts. I was seriously almost ready to commit myself -but I’ve slowly been able to control it more and more.
I’ve ruled everything else (medical induced) and started tapering. I seem to have the most “anxiety” in between dosing time . I’m on lexapro now too (10 days). They also prescribed me xanex but I don’t want to mix the two so I’ve only taken it 2x.
I’ve stopped drinking coffee and living my normal life. Previous to this ‘anxiety’ I was doing very well and lost 80 lbs and was working out 6 days a week. I was content, even happy sometimes.

"Suboxone in Texas, just moved from Louisiana. Hi, kind of new to Reddit so I’m sorry if this is in the wrong place. I’ve been on long term Suboxone maintenance for over 10 years. It truly saved my life. Once I got clean and stuck with the right combination of medications life has been awesome. I have lived a happy drug and alcohol free life since day one.
I got an amazing work opportunity so I moved from Louisiana to the Pleasanting Texas area. I had a week to decide if I wanted to accept their offer so I left Louisiana within a very short time frame.
I haven’t had any luck finding a doctor who will prescribe all of my meds. It’s tricky because I have ADHD and also take a low dose of Adderol. My doctor and I tried several non stimulant medications over the years but non worked so we kind of just shelved treatment. I’ve never tried to refill early, switch doctors or relapsed, so a few years ago my doctor suggested we go ahead and try Adderol. It’s been a game changer and I take it as prescribed. 
I guess this is where it gets tricky. I have not been able to find a doctor who will prescribe Suboxone, Adderol and three other non controlled medications. I have found one for the ADHD and other issues but have yet to find one for Suboxone. Does anyone know if there is a doctor I can go to who will treat everything? If worse comes to worse I could go to two doctors but that gets expensive and I question if anyone would prescribe Suboxone at all since I am being prescribed Adderol from another doctor. I don’t mind going in person if need be.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Thinking of starting on Subs - Some questions.. So I'm thinking subs might be useful for me, but I have some questions.

My first is when should I take my first one? I take poppy pods which last a real long time. If I take a large dose I only start feeling  withdrawals after 48 hours, and even then it's mild. It starts building from there and I can imagine they would get pretty severe at 72 hours (I haven't made it that far in a while). So does 72 hours sound good? Too early/too late?

My second is what is the shortest time that would be useful? I want to use it strictly to detox, I'm not interested in maintenance. I've heard some people say 7 day detox is best, some say 14, some say 8 week. In your experience what is the best way to use subutex to help detox?

"messed up again.. I'll start from the beginning. I started 8mg buprenorphine tablets in 2018 and was completely clean until this year. I had a bad toothache in March and an old friend had reached out offering me heroin so I took it. I didn't know anything about precipitated withdrawals until I went to take my sub about 6 hours after the ""heroin"" wore off. Then I did my research and learned from the internet that for fentanyl you have to wait until you're in mild to moderate withdrawal so in April one weekend I waited about 16 hours and took my subs and was able to get back on them. Fast forward to the beginning of August and I had another bad toothache and quit taking my subs so that the fent would hit better. I tried last weekend to get back on my subs and waited 20 hours from my last shot only to be put back in precipitated withdrawals and I had to get back on the fent so I could work, (I can't lose my job, my wife and 2 kids depend on me.).

I made a post in a few different spots asking for a way to figure out a solid way to tell if there is fent in any H anyone does. Granted I'm still using, is there a safe time frame or dosage I can take to not make myself sick? The last thing I want to do is fall into PWD going into this appointment and I truly want to be done. I had a friend steal my subs to ""teach me a lesson"" and I deserved to feel pain because of things I did when I was in bad active usage. He's a ""normie"" and it was super messed up. This happened about 20 days ago right when I got my script and thank god I had some subs at home but I've been holding them for the appointment. If it makes a difference they're the 8mg orange sub pills. I don't want to continue this trend and I obviously cut this friend out.",0,1,0,1,0,0

"Is suboxone withdrawal worse than most other opioids?. I've heard from a few ppl(who probably haven't even been on suboxone or had to come off of them before) that the withdrawal symptoms from buprenorphrine are worse than say heroin or fentanyl. I know this might be sort of an opinion type thing and that you can't really forsure say between fent and suboxone that one would be worse bc most fent now is just analogues of fent where they change 1 little part of the chemical  so it makes it different enough to skirt the legality of the FDA control substances stuff, so they can still sell it aslong as they label it not for human consumption. I guess the reason I brought all that up is to say since there has been so little research done on these drugs that there probably isn't a definite answer for the type of fent I've been using vs suboxone, but maybe someone could tell me what they know about the W.D. symptoms of buprenorphrine vs fentanyl vs heroin(like which is the most mild, how long they last and if one has an effect th3 other doesn't, basically just any general info is appreciated I'm hoping I can hear/learn something on here I haven't already from doing Google searches lol thank u all",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Question about QuickMD drug testing process.. To make a long story as short as possible, my wife has been on Suboxone for 6-7 years now. She’s also completely bedridden and unable to walk after a serious health issue in March of 2021. She was in the hospital and short term rehab for physical therapy for a few months and fortunately was able to have a provider that would work with her and she was able to still get her Suboxone through video appointments and me picking up cheek swab kits from the office and dropping them off. Everything was cool until the practice changed ownership. They weren’t willing to work with her situation and discharged her from the practice. In order to leave the house she’d have to be transported by private ambulance so thankfully I found QuickMD through this sub and she has her first appointment on Wednesday. 

I’m wondering how the cheek swab test works and if her not being able to leave the house is going to cause any issues. I couldn’t find anything on their site explaining how exactly it’s administered since the providers are seen via Telehealth.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Starting Suboxone?. I want to apologize first for any unclear or messy part of this post feeling a bit out of it. 

A bit of background is I ended up in the hospital 6 days ago, I was using opioids and benzo’s mainly but a lot of other drugs and alcohol also. I had some withdrawal symptoms but nothing too severe or unbearable and I think the majority of the withdrawals were related to benzo’s. 

The doctors were really pushing for me to start suboxone because my goal is to go to treatment I. The next few weeks. So I started on 4 mg, 2 days ago. I felt pretty unwell the first day I was nauseated, sweaty, confused and dizzy. I would go from being completely exhausted to rambling to my nurse about anything and everything (felt like I couldn’t stop talking).   The second day on and off I felt a bit of nausea, a head ache and a bit sweaty but a lot less confused and out of it. An hour ago I started 6mg and I’m feeling fine so far just tired. I’m a bit nervous about Suboxone overall. The doctor recommended a dose between 8-12mg. I’m scared I’ll won’t be able to get off of it, but the doctor said that at a dose of  8-12 it would probably take about a month to stop. 

My question are; is it common to feel sick when you’re first starting? 
(I feel like maybe my opioid addiction wasn’t severe enough and that’s why I’m reacting this way)

Do you think it would be that easy to come off of? And if not do you think the treatment is worth it?

Also any other advice or thoughts is greatly appreciated",0,0,1,1,1,0

"Almost 96 hours after jumping from .1. I just want everyone to know it may seem difficult at times, but if you want to get off the subs you absolutely can. I was at 20mg for 6 months before tapering by 2mg a month. The best dose I had through that time was 8mg I felt so much better. Continuing on it was all very smooth until I jumped from 2mg to 1mg, had a couple weeks of shitty medium withdrawals. Then to 0.5 for a month or so, fluctuated slightly but consistently dropped about .1 every month. When I was at the .1-.2 range it was like I was in full withdrawal by the time I woke up in the morning, this went on a few weeks so I said fuck it and jumped from .1mg approximately. First two days were very uncomfortable but not unbearable. Mostly just RLS, insomnia, and muscle soreness as well as no energy. 3rd day which is today went great, more energy and I can slowly feel a sense of normalcy returning. The lower doses I always felt like minor withdrawal all day, so I finally said fuck it and jumped from .1mg. I definitely recommend getting as low as possible because if I jumped from even a .5mg it would’ve been much worse I feel.

"What happens if something really bad happens and you need an emergency administration of powerful opiodes. My question is, god forbid, in some sort of emergency situation and a person needs powerful pain relief or relief of any kind (that opiodes would provide in an emergency situation) but is already on buprenorphine? Would they just be fucked? I'm asking because of my own personal anxiety and I'm on 16mgs of Suboxone for now. Like what happens if you get in a car accident and NEED immediate relief or would they just sedate you with an anesthetic if you're in enough pain? I guess it's situational but is it possible to get relief from a shot of medical grade fentynal while on bupe already? Would u end up in PWD reversely somehow?",0,1,1,0,0,0
"3 days till jump. Been taking 0.25 in the morning and 0.20 at night. Been a struggle during the day.

But today I took my dose at 0.20 this am and so far outside being a bit tired, I feel I finally adjust to taking 0.25 or less in the day. I'll be working down my night dose and just taking during the day,  0.25 starting tomorrow and Sunday since I don't have work or anything.

The worst symptoms of the taper seem to be 3 hours between my day and night dose unless I stay busy and I wake up at 5am most mornings with a stomach ache. Advil and a 0.25 Xanax seems to help me get back to sleep and feel comfort. I've avoided the Xanax during the day and found CBD vape oil to be extremely helpful and it seems to last even the day after as far as therapeutic relief. I also run 3 days a week

So with the jump coming up, im guessing this is pretty positive with taking such a little crumb in morning being ok to deal for 12 hours. I will have a month off work, therapy and going to New York for a trip on day 27 for 4 days.

Just got to get through these next 2 weeks coming up. But I guess it's a good sign I can take so little and not have bad withdrawls.",0,0,1,0,1,0
"Getting off Oxy with Temgesic. Hello, I live in Latin America and take 360+mg of Oxy IR/day. It is time to stop. I have experience with quitting/withdrawal as I was a former IV heroin user (yes, I got clean off the needle to eventually start using Oxy's like an idiot years and years later.) I have access to .2 Temgesic. A few questions:

1) Temgesic is .2 MG Bupe and nothing else. No Naloxone. Do I need to be in withdrawal before I use straight Bupe? Or does that only pertain to Naloxone?  
2) Can I swallow or snort the Temgesic? I cant do sublingual. I tried with vitamins in the past. I just cannot do it, I will vomit.  
3) What happens if I use Oxy and Bupe simultaneously to taper off the Oxy if it gets out of control? Is this possible?  
4) VERY SILLY QUESTION: .2 seems... so minimal. My habit on a scale from 1-10 is 8ish. I think i would need closer to 16/mg bupe a day. How is .2 even a thing? Is it even worth trying with these? I bought three boxes for about $100. There are 10 in a box. I feel like I'm wasting my time and should just taper the Oxy and go through the shit because I suck and got myself in this situation.

"almost 30 days off subs! honestly- a near painless experience. i have v high anxiety, and this forum terrified me over the jump. do not let people trip you up! Lmk questions :). What nobody told me is pretty much 80% of the withdrawl happens under 1 mg. at < .5 doses, it is metabolized to such low levels, it only provides a few hours of relief. 

someone shared this with me over reddit, and I didn’t really believe them, but I noticed while the ends of the day were certainly a little more shitty (bad mood, fatigue) they were not bad at all or anything I would consider to be withdrawl. 

After reading that I thought I would give a shot at skipping days, as I supposedly already had I guess relatively small amounts of bupe in my system 

next thing I knew I accidentally went 4 days without any sub! 

took a tiny .15 mg dose, as i’m not in a hurry and wanted to land this plane smoothly as possible. after that last dose I noticed an upswing in my mood as soon as day 4. it’s gotten better every week since!

So fellas! land this plane! you wouldn’t crash it into the ground right? you wouldn’t speed up as you got closer to the runway, right? the closer you get to the finish line , the lighter you pull up on the “plane” and your efforts.

"Existing benzo script with telehealth. I’m hoping someone can help me or give me some advice. I have been on bupe (subutex) for 12 years. Over the past year I moved from Southern California to the Bay Area, so I needed to find a new dr. I’ve been stable for a long time, so I actually tapered down and stopped for awhile, but the withdrawals were bad so I got back on by using my stockpile of bupe at home. I’m getting towards the end of my stockpile, so I need to get a new script.

At the same time, I got a new psychiatrist and have a prescription for Xanax. I don’t abuse the Xanax and only take it when I need it. It’s a low dose and I do not up it.

My question is - is it going to be ok with Telehealth (thinking of using quickmd), to have a Xanax prescription and also get bupe treatment? I already talked this over with my Psych and he is aware and ok with me on both. 

Second question - I was just going to have telehealth use the same pharmacy I use for my Xanax, I don’t want to do anything weird and really just want to “follow the rules”. Is my pharmacy going to give me any hassle?

"Blessed and ready to do this forreal.. I am in such a good position to finally do this forreal and really start my journey getting clean and out of active addiction. I finally, after a year and a half of trying, have gotten approved for state insurance, which in my state just about 100% covers anything and everything related to addiction treatment. Equally, got back in touch with an old plug that has real #4 heroin which I've started taking instead of this fent crap, so when I go see my sub Dr on Monday, it'll be easy as hell to actually transition to subs without any fear of PWD issues :) Icing on the cake, just got hired somewhere making $900/week cash under the table while this is all going on. Equally, since my Dr knows how much I've struggled with everything, after a week of getting subs into my system, he will have no issue giving me the sublocade injection the following week, and state insurance completely covers the procedure. Add to all this, I qualified for a grant where my tuition for school next year to become an AODA counselor is 100% covered, so I'm enrolled and ready to have an honest to God career by this time next year :) it's been a rough 3 yrs in active addiction, but this light at the end of the tunnel I'm seeing today has me giddy :)

Ways so. Do you think this is just for the oral type of ketoconazole, or if I lather it all over my body and let it sit for 5 minutes like directions say will it absorb into my bloodstream and get me HIGH? 

I don’t even really have hair so I’m guessing they meant lather all over body.

"Why no taper dose?. I have been on suboxone for almost 10 years at this point. I have tried to stop a couple times but after suffering intense withdrawals lasting for 2-3 weeks without any end in sight, I always start up again because I had to be functioning for work and family. After failing to quit because of mentally and physical excruciating withdrawals I’ve become deterred to try again. 
It seems to me after doing deep research to get off this medication you need to be stable on .5-.25 a mg before jumping without suffering LONG withdrawal symptoms. Trying to cut a single 8 mg strip into 16-32 individual daily doses is a ridiculous task to make for someone. The fact that the lowest dose is 2 mg strips is almost proof the pharmaceutical companies have zero compassion for people that want to get off opiates. The goal isn’t ever to get your endorphin/opioid system back to normal but to make a lifelong patient of us. Not talking about those that need suboxone to stabilize there life, but those of us that have made permanent changes to our behavior. 
Well I am on day 6 of jumping from around 1mg, basically a speck of a 8mg strip. Today I wish I would of dropped down to a smaller dose before jumping last Wednesday but doesn’t seem realistic as smaller doses don’t exist and become impossible to accurately measure. Asking patient to cut up there strips in microscopic doses is such BS. 
When a normal .125-.2 mg form of buprenorphine becomes available and offered to patients that are ready to get back to their potential, then I will respect the MAT community rather than a group of big organizations that just wants to sink its hooks into us and our insurance.",0,1,0,0,1,0
"New here... I have a few questions. I just started Suboxone yesterday. I was in full blown withdrawal from painkillers. I have been on pain killers for about 14 years about about 6 years ago I started to abuse them. Yesterday I felt great after my first dose. I don't really know how to explain it but the craving for painkillers was just gone. I wasn't sitting at my desk all day trying to figure out how to get high, my pain was gone, I actually got a lot of work  done. Iwas functional. I'm ready to get my life back in track. My question is how long will I be needing to be on the Suboxone? Am I just trading one addiction for another? I am starting counseling soon, seeing my primary care Dr. I'm doing all the steps I need to kick this habit. But I don't want to become dependent on these. Is it possible to be in Suboxone for a few months and then be done?

"What to expect?. Hi all,

&#x200B;

So long story short I've never taken Suboxone before, I had a small amount given to me in partial exchange for some weed, which I've been smoking for years. While I have no intention of ""getting into"" Suboxone or any other drugs really, I am curious about it and I'd like to try taking some since I have it in front of me. How much should I take and what should I expect after I do? Keep in mind I've only ever smoked weed, no hard drugs or anything else.

About 2.5 months off subutex. Any questions on tapering refer to my old posts. Body functions and mental health back to normal-relatively due to the impending apocalypse but yeah. Was able to get rid of all my pills. I just recently injured myself badly (torn hamstring)  I did save 1 pill for emergency I know that's my way of rationalizing it and I am laid up with my injury plus quarantine has too much time on my hands but I promised myself I wont cave in. I know what people will say flush it and I'm about to I I just want to stay away from hospitals and had it if I was in extreme pain. If I take any I know it's all I have and luckily have no connections but I understand I'm playing with fire spare me the advice I know I'm just doing shitty atm with the virus but I'm keeping willpower.,0,0,0,0,0,1
"Down to 2mg a day. Finally successfully lowered my dose down to 2mg. It’s been a long time coming. Started at 12-16 like most of us. I’m so sick of being on this drug I cannot wait to get off. 

Finally starting to feel like a normal human being again. I want to just jump off where I’m at, however the lower I can get the better. This drug has fucked up my circadian rhythm so bad some nights I don’t fall asleep until 7 or 8 am. 

Anhedonia and slightly worse insomnia are the only symptoms I’ve been experiencing with the reduction. 

My question is has anyone jumped at 2mg a day. I already know what everyone is going to say DONT DO IT ITS GONNA SUCK! I understand that but this is my life, I’m so sick of being on this dog shit I don’t care if I’m sick for a couple weeks or not at this point.

"Close To The Jump: What To Expect?. Hi all,

I saw subsux was permanently off line today and was kinda bummed, it was a great source of info. It really gave me hope. I found this Reddit and rejoiced that there’s still a place for us to congregate and share what we’ve learned.

I’m 37 and been taking sub for ~4years. I started at 12mg, but I’ve tapered down to .375mg/day (.25 morning and .125 before bed).

I know people have jumped from every possible dose, but I’m wondering where a good place to do so for me would be? I’ve been dropping ~.25mg every 10 ish days and it’s been relatively painless. No comfort meds outside of pot.

"Looking to get on Sub or Methadone Program - Australia. Hey guys,

To cut a very long story short, after 15yrs+ of a daily opiate dependence, I’ve decided to finally try and get on a Bupe/suboxone or Methadone program.

I’m originally from the UK and it’s incredibly easy to get hold of most opiates on the internet and at GPs legitimately there. I’ve been a completely functioning opiate user most of my life and I’ve worked some hard jobs whilst still managing to compartmentalise my opiate dependence. Over the last 3-4 years, I’ve actually had Dihydrocodiene prescribed for a minor back problem which has helped massively for my mental health along with tramadol. For reference, was on about 8 x 30mg Dihydrocodiene a day then went onto 500mg of tramadol a day.

I came to Australia about a year ago with the hope to successfully continue my habit. Unfortunately, I’ve found out the hard way how difficult & expensive it is to get any opiates. I’m managing to get by on Poppy seed tea with weekly otc Rikodiene syrup purchases but it’s just not doing anything for me. I’m currently spending $100s a week on fuelling my habit and I just can’t deal with the stress & anxiety of financing and actually getting any opiates.

I’ve got a few questions with regards to anyone who’s on either program here if that’s ok? What are peoples experiences with Subs and the whole process? Can you pick what treatment is best for you? How much does it cost? 

Another predicament is that I’m on a provisional PR Visa and I’m worrieD my addiction treatment will affect my visa process 🤦🏻‍♂️ 

Anyway any info whatsoever would be much appreciated. Thank you!",1,0,0,0,0,0
Curious... my brother was prescribed Suboxone because of a fentanyl problem. I don’t talk to him at the moment / for the past month because long story short I gave him options to get better and he turned them down and I told him I wouldn’t watch him kill himself so I deleted all socials and blocked his number. I learned from my other siblings his po officer prescribed this too him because he refused treatment again. What does this medication do? And does it help people with that kind of addiction?,0,0,0,1,0,0
